## Affected Individual(s)

### Rev. Susie Hayward
- **Church:** Creekside UCC, Minneapolis
- **Role:** Minister for Justice Organizing
- **What happened:** Shoved by DHS agent; exposed to pepper spray that drifted through crowd

### Rev. Ashley Horan
- **Organization:** Unitarian Universalist Association
- **Role:** Vice President for Programs and Ministries

## What Happened
After news broke of the ICE shooting of Renee Good, dozens of clergy and community members rushed to the scene on Portland Avenue.

**Rev. Hayward's account:** A DHS agent shoved her while walking past. When another agent exited a vehicle and began spraying demonstrators with pepper spray, the irritant drifted through the crowd, affecting Hayward.

**Rev. Horan's account:** While livestreaming the scene, an agent can be seen on video firing what appears to be a pepper round just a few feet from her head, sending her and other protesters fleeing into the residential neighborhood.

## Broader Context
According to Religion News Service, Rev. Hayward joins a list of at least eight clergy members nationally who have encountered chemical agents or been shot with pepper spray, pepper rounds, or pepper bullets while protesting Trump's mass deportation efforts. At least eight clergy (all in Chicago) have also been arrested while protesting.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple religious news outlets (Religion News Service, National Catholic Reporter, Baptist News Global) with named clergy sources. Video evidence of pepper round being fired exists. Part of documented pattern of clergy being targeted during immigration enforcement protests.
