## Witness Account
**Jenny (through interview with CBS Minnesota):**

> "I was yelling at them to take me with him, but they didn't want to take me and our daughter with him."

> "I was asking them to deport me because I don't want to be left alone with my daughter."

> "My daughter was very frightened and is going to miss her father."

> "I don't have a job — only my husband does — and now I don't know what we're going to do."

## Criminal History
**None reported.** News coverage does not indicate any criminal allegations against Jenny's husband or cousin. DHS has not issued a statement claiming criminal history for those detained in this arrest, in contrast to other arrests where DHS has highlighted criminal records.

## Context
This arrest occurred amid approximately 3,400 ICE arrests in Minnesota over the weekend of January 25-27, 2026, as part of the ongoing Operation Metro Surge.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence of the arrest exists. Named family member (Jenny) provided direct interview to CBS Minnesota with detailed quotes. Consistent with pattern of documented family separations during Operation Metro Surge.
