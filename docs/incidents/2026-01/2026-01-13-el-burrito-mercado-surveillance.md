# ICE Using El Burrito Mercado as "Hunting Ground" - 47-Year-Old Business Under Siege

## Summary
Federal immigration agents have been circling El Burrito Mercado, a prominent 47-year-old Mexican supermarket and restaurant in St. Paul's West Side, for over a week. CEO Milissa Silva-Diaz stated "ICE is using my business as a hunting ground" as unmarked vans and masked agents have scared off customers and workers, forcing the business to close or limit hours. The business has implemented safety measures including posting guards at entrances.

## Statements

### CEO Milissa Silva-Diaz
"ICE is using my business as a hunting ground."

"They're swirling around the block waiting for people."

"This is not sustainable."

### Social Media Statement

## Context
El Burrito Mercado is a landmark in St. Paul's Latino community, once called a "mini-empire" by Eater. The surveillance represents the economic terror being inflicted on immigrant-owned businesses during Operation Metro Surge. The state lawsuit against DHS cited businesses reporting 50-80% revenue declines.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - National news coverage (CNN Business). Named business owner on record. Multiple local sources (Fox 9, Pioneer Press, Bring Me The News). Documented economic impact. Specific, verifiable location. Part of documented pattern of business disruption during Operation Metro Surge.
