# Latino U.S. Citizen Tackled, Knee Pressed Into Neck, Driven Around and Dumped in Parking Lot

## Summary
A 22-year-old Latino U.S. citizen, identified in court documents as "Javier Doe," was brutally detained by Border Patrol agents near his workplace at a Target store in Richfield in early January 2026. After telling agents he did not have to answer questions about his citizenship, they tackled him, handcuffed him, pressed a knee into his neck, drove him around in an SUV while playing loud music, and eventually released him in a Walmart parking lot in Bloomington after reviewing his passport. He required emergency medical care for his injuries. He is now a plaintiff in the ACLU class-action lawsuit against ICE.

   - Agents pressed a knee into his neck
   - He slipped and his head slammed into the SUV
5. **Unlawful Detention:** Agents drove him around in an SUV while playing loud music
6. **Release:** Eventually released in a Walmart parking lot in Bloomington after reviewing his passport

## Official Accounts

### DHS Response
A DHS spokesperson called the allegations in the lawsuit "disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE."

### ACLU Statement
Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, staff attorney with ACLU of Minnesota: "ICE and CBP's practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible. Federal agents' conduct—sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests—is a grave violation of Minnesotans' most fundamental rights."

## Legal Action
Javier Doe is one of three plaintiffs in ACLU of Minnesota's class-action lawsuit filed January 15, 2026:
- **Case:** Filed in federal court
- **Defendants:** DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons
- **Relief sought:** Statewide injunction against racial profiling and excessive force

## Pattern of Conduct
This incident demonstrates pattern of:
- Targeting Latino residents based on appearance
- Violent response to assertion of constitutional rights
- Knee-to-neck restraint technique (echoes of George Floyd killing in same metro area)
- Psychological intimidation (loud music during transport)
- Abandonment after release (dumped in parking lot miles away)

## Context
The incident occurred during Operation Metro Surge, the largest immigration enforcement operation in American history. This case, along with those of Mubashir Khalif Hussen and Mahamed Eydarus, formed the basis for the ACLU's class-action lawsuit seeking to stop racial profiling by federal agents.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Named plaintiff in federal lawsuit with detailed sworn allegations. Multiple major news sources (Star Tribune, NBC News, CNN, Common Dreams). Documented physical injuries requiring emergency care. Part of pattern showing systematic brutality against citizens asserting rights. ACLU legal representation adds credibility.
