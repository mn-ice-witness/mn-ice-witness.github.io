## Summary
Nadya, a Moldovan refugee with legal status awaiting her green card, was detained by ICE on January 17, 2026 while driving from her home to church with her husband and three children. Five ICE vehicles stopped the family shortly after they left their house. Despite the family explaining they had refugee status and were in the process of obtaining green cards, ICE detained only Nadya and released her husband and children. She has been held in poor conditions, in handcuffs and sleeping on the floor.

## Family Statements

### Victoria (sister, from GoFundMe)
> "On January 17, Nadya was detained by ICE despite entering the U.S. legally and having her documents in order while waiting for her Green Card. She has been held for two days in poor conditions, in handcuffs and sleeping on the floor."

> "At home, her husband and three children are under extreme stress. The family cannot afford an immigration attorney, and Nadya's husband is unable to work while caring for the children."

### Facebook Post (friend/acquaintance)
> "Nadya is one of the nicest and kindest ladies I have ever met!! Her English is bad as she has just recently immigrated into the US as a refugee and is here LEGALLY."

> "She was an art/craft teacher back in Moldova and was making the most amazing bags, toys, sweaters that she is selling online and teaching kids art in order to help support her family! She does not have any criminal record!"

> "Nadya, her husband and their 3 kids were driving from home to their church and at some point shortly after leaving their house, 5 ICE cars ambushed them. They tried to explain that they have a refugee status and are currently in the process of obtaining their green cards. ICE officers detained only Nadya and let her husband and kids go."

## Context: Operation PARRIS

Nadya's detention fits a documented pattern of ICE targeting refugees with pending green card applications under **Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening). According to [Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-fraud-dhs-launching-operation-parris-target-refugees-jan-9), approximately 5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota are being targeted through this [official DHS operation](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota).

[Global Refuge](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) has documented that lawfully present refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."
