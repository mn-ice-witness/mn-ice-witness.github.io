# Federal Agents Execute Search Warrant at Wrong Address

## Summary
FBI, ATF, and Hennepin County Sheriff's Office agents used a battering ram to enter Alisa Porter's South Minneapolis apartment, handcuffing her daughter and searching the home. The warrant was for a different address—the man they sought had lived in the unit above Porter's but moved out two months prior. The search was connected to items stolen from FBI vehicles during protests over recent ICE shootings.

## Official Accounts

### Federal Agencies
An ATF spokesperson declined to comment due to the "ongoing nature of this operation" but confirmed the agency executed a search warrant in Minneapolis.

The operation involved multiple agencies: FBI, ATF, and Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office stated they were conducting a criminal investigation and executing multiple search warrants for items stolen from federal vehicles on Wednesday night, including a firearm, multiple FBI access badges, wallets, driver's licenses, and credit cards.

### Local Officials
No statements from local officials documented.

## Witness Accounts
Alisa Porter: "This is not the place you're supposed to be at looking for anything."

Porter stated her daughter "was scared to death" when agents handcuffed her during the search. Porter also confirmed the man named on the warrant had lived in the unit above hers but moved out two months ago.

A neighbor called Porter during the search to inform her what was happening.

## Context
This search occurred during a period of heightened federal law enforcement activity in Minneapolis related to Operation Metro Surge. The items stolen from FBI vehicles were taken during protests following ICE shooting incidents in the area. This was not an immigration enforcement action but is included to document the broader federal enforcement presence affecting Minneapolis residents.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent sources (CBS Minnesota, The Mirror), video evidence from Ring doorbell camera, and documented discrepancy between warrant address (2926) and victim's address (2928 Apt 2). Federal agency confirmed the operation occurred.
