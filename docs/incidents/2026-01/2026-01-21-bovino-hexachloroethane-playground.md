# Border Patrol Deploys Toxic Green Gas Near School at Dismissal (UNVERIFIED)

***No mainstream media has reported on this incident. It is based on social media posts only. If you have a media source, please [contact us](mailto:mnicewitness@proton.me).***

## Summary

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino and agents allegedly deployed multiple canisters of green chemical gas at Mueller Park, near Ella Baker Global Studies & Humanities Magnet School, just after school dismissal. A school bus was reportedly forced to drive through the gas while transporting students home.

## What Is Alleged

According to social media accounts:

- Agents fired multiple canisters of green chemical gas at Mueller Park
- Gas spread across the playground, through the park, and into residential blocks
- A school bus was forced to drive through the smoke
- Children were heading to the park and buses were transporting students home
- Video shows Bovino ordering people to "get back" before deploying gas
- Protesters were standing on public sidewalks filming, not blocking vehicles
- Gas was thrown toward the park and playground, not into the street
- Agents then walked onto public sidewalk and assaulted people recording

## Health Concerns

The green gas is consistent with hexachloroethane (HC), which causes burning skin/eyes, coughing, vomiting, chest pain, and respiratory injury. It poses risk of long-term lung damage and is especially dangerous for children, infants, pregnant people, and those with asthma. The U.S. military stopped using HC decades ago due to its toxicity.

## Background

Bovino serves as Border Patrol Commander at Large. A federal judge found him ["outright lying"](https://www.fox9.com/news/border-patrol-chief-was-outright-lying-about-previous-ice-surge) about use of force during the Chicago operation. Multiple sources have raised concerns about [HC gas use in Minneapolis](https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2026/01/my-eyes-were-stinging-the-chemicals-used-by-ice-when-they-confront-protesters-tear-gas-minneapolis/).

## Editorial Assessment

**UNVERIFIED** - Based on social media posts. Video reportedly exists. Consistent with documented concerns about HC gas deployment in Minneapolis, but requires mainstream media corroboration.
