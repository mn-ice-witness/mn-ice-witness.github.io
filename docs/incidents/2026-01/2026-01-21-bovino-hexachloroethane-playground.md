# Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino Deploys Hexachloroethane Gas Near School at Dismissal

## Summary

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino deployed gas canisters at Mueller Park, near Ella Baker Global Studies & Humanities Magnet School, just after school dismissal. Video shows Bovino personally throwing the canister. A school bus was forced to drive through the gas while transporting students home.

Hexachloroethane is classified as a chemical weapon under the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachloroethane) and is banned from use in international warfare. The U.S. military phased out HC smoke grenades after a [1994 Army report](https://cbrneworld.com/privacy?view=article&id=1782:were-toxic-chemical-grenades-used-in-portland&catid=2) found that "exposure of unprotected soldiers to high concentrations of HC smoke for even a few minutes has resulted in injuries and fatalities."

The [EPA classifies hexachloroethane](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/hexachloroethane.pdf) as a possible human carcinogen. The [Department of Health and Human Services](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Tsp/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=869&toxid=169) has determined it "may reasonably be anticipated to be a carcinogen." Health effects include central nervous system depression, kidney and liver damage, and respiratory injuries ranging from coughing to [pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1459933/). When burned, HC produces toxic byproducts including phosgene.

## What Happened

According to eyewitness accounts and video:

- Agents fired multiple canisters of green chemical gas at Mueller Park
- Gas spread across the playground, through the park, and into residential blocks
- A school bus was forced to drive through the smoke
- Children were heading to the park and buses were transporting students home
- Video shows Bovino ordering people to "get back" before deploying gas
- Protesters were standing on public sidewalks filming, not blocking vehicles
- Gas was thrown toward the park and playground, not into the street
- Agents then walked onto public sidewalk and assaulted people recording

## Background

Bovino serves as Border Patrol Commander at Large. A federal judge found him ["outright lying"](https://www.fox9.com/news/border-patrol-chief-was-outright-lying-about-previous-ice-surge) about use of force during the Chicago operation. Multiple sources have raised concerns about [HC gas use in Minneapolis](https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2026/01/my-eyes-were-stinging-the-chemicals-used-by-ice-when-they-confront-protesters-tear-gas-minneapolis/).
