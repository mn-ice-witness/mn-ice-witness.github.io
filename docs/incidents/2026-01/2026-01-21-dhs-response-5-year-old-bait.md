# DHS Response: "Child Was ABANDONED," Father "Fled on Foot"

## Summary

DHS posted on X responding to reports that ICE agents used a 5-year-old child as "bait" during a January 20 arrest in Columbia Heights. DHS claims ICE "did NOT target a child" and that the father "fled on foot—abandoning his child" when agents approached. School officials provided a different account of the sequence of events.

## Official Statement

Posted on X (@DHSgov):

> "ICE did NOT target a child. The child was ABANDONED.
>
> On January 20, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias an illegal alien from Ecuador who was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration.
>
> As agents approached the driver Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot—abandoning his child. For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.
>
> Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement. Parents can take control of their departure and receive a free flight and $2,600 with the CBP Home app. By using the CBP Home app illegal aliens reserve the chance to come back the right legal way."

## Points of Discrepancy

**On the sequence of events:** DHS states the father "fled on foot—abandoning his child" when agents approached. Columbia Heights Superintendent Zena Stenvik provided a different account to reporters: ICE agents took the child from the vehicle and led him to the front door, instructing him to knock on the door to see if anyone else was home. In the superintendent's account, ICE had custody of the child before the father was apprehended.

**On the family's legal status:** DHS describes Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias as "an illegal alien" who was "RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration." The family's attorney stated they arrived at an official U.S. entry point, have an active asylum case, and have no deportation order. Superintendent Stenvik said she viewed the family's legal paperwork: "This family is following U.S. legal parameters and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation."

**On the "bait" allegation:** DHS did not address the specific claim by school officials that the 5-year-old was used as "bait" to approach the front door.

**On family care:** School officials reported that another adult in the home requested to care for the child during the arrest, but agents refused.

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Official DHS statement on @DHSgov. The DHS account of events differs from the account provided by Columbia Heights school officials and the family's attorney, as reported by CBS Minnesota, Fox 9, MPR News, and other outlets.
