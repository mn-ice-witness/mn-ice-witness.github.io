## Key Quotes

### From O'Keefe's USA Today Opinion Piece

On the agents' demeanor during transport:
> "One agent took a photo of me and showed it to the others, laughing. Another called me ugly. His colleague, apparently referring to Renee Good, said, 'You guys gotta stop obstructing us — that's why that lesbian bitch is dead.' In the presence of these masked men with weapons strapped to their bodies — men who claim to be safeguarding our cities — I felt only terrorized and vulnerable."

On conditions inside the Whipple Building:
> "The despondent faces and the screaming, wailing and pleading from these men, women and children — reportedly as young as 5 years old — will forever haunt me. But perhaps more haunting still was the sound of agents nearby laughing. Are our lives all just a joke to them?"

On a fellow detainee (Marine Corps veteran):
> "One of those veterans — scraped up and bruised at both wrist and ankle from the ICE agents' aggression — talked about how ironic and shocking it was that the first time she had a gun pointed at her it was by the very government she swore an oath to serve."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - First-person account published by USA Today, corroborated by AP, Snopes, Sahan Journal documentary, CATO Institute, and on-the-record interviews with both detainees across multiple outlets.
