## Official Statement

Full statement from President Donald Trump on Truth Social:

> DHS & ICE must start talking about murderers & criminals they are capturing & taking out of the system. They are saving many innocent lives! There are thousands of vicious animals in MN alone... The people will start supporting the Patriots of ICE, instead of the highly paid troublemakers

## Context

This statement is part of a series of escalating rhetoric from President Trump regarding the Minnesota ICE operations. Earlier this month, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act against Minnesota if state and local officials did not stop interfering with ICE operations.

On January 15, 2026, Trump wrote on Truth Social: "If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State."

Trump has repeatedly characterized protesters as "highly paid professionals," "troublemakers, agitators, and insurrectionists," and "thugs." He has also referred to Minnesota officials including Governor Tim Walz and Representative Ilhan Omar as "corrupt politicians" who have "totally lost control."

The "vicious animals" language echoes Trump's prior statements about immigrants. In late 2025, he called Somali immigrants "garbage" and claimed without evidence that "Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for 'prey.'"
