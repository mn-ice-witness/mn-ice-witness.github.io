## Witness Accounts
Phil Maddox told The Intercept he recorded the video on Sunday morning during a quick drive around his neighborhood to keep tabs on federal agents in the area.

Maddox said he immediately interpreted the question as a threat: "They're saying, 'Get in our way and we'll shoot you. We have immunity, we can do what we want, and you should fear us.'"

Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for the immigrant rights group Unidos Minnesota, told The Intercept: "That's a veiled threat, 1,000 percent. They can't exactly say it, but the way they reference Renee Good — they're using that to strike fear."

## Related Pattern

The Intercept documented multiple ICE agents using similar language in separate encounters:
- In another video, an agent tells someone: "You don't fucking learn — what's fuckin' happened in the last couple of days"
- The same agent approaches a woman filming from a second vehicle: "Listen, have y'all not learned from the past couple of days? Have you not learned?"
- The woman responds: "Learned what? What's our lesson here? What do you want us to learn?"
