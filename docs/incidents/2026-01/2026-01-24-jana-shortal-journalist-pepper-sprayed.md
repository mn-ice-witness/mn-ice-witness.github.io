# KARE 11 Journalist Jana Shortal Pushed, Pepper Sprayed While Covering Fatal Shooting

## Summary

KARE 11 anchor Jana Shortal was pushed twice by federal agents and pepper sprayed in her left eye while covering the aftermath of a fatal shooting by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis. Shortal was behind police lines with visible press credentials when agents ordered the crowd to move back. Despite identifying herself as press, an agent pushed her repeatedly, causing her to fall backwards before she felt a burning sensation in her eye. Protesters immediately helped flush her eye and provided medical assistance.

## Witness Accounts

### Jana Shortal's Account (KARE 11)

> "I said, 'Do not push me, I'm press.' And then he did it again and I fell backwards and I said, 'I'm press.' And then I felt this burn in my eye."

Shortal emphasized she was in the appropriate position with a press credential, behind the police line, observing interactions between protesters and Border Patrol agents.

### On Community Response

> "These people opened their apartment complex to help, medics came. I mean, there's a lot of people out here that are trying to help. I know some folks hear these chants, and they say, 'Everybody's bad at these protests,' but it's not true. They helped me, and they gave me towels and a new shirt."

## Context: The Fatal Shooting

The incident occurred during the immediate aftermath of a fatal shooting by federal agents:

- **Victim:** 37-year-old white male, Minneapolis resident, U.S. citizen
- **Status:** Lawful gun owner with valid permit to carry, no criminal record
- **DHS claim:** Man "approached Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun" and "violently resisted" disarming
- **Video evidence:** CBS Minnesota reviewed video showing "several federal agents surrounding a person on the ground" and "one of the agents hits the person with a gun several times before several gunshots are heard." Multiple videos showed the person "without a weapon in hand before agents tackled him to the ground."
- **Police Chief O'Hara:** Said victim's only interaction with law enforcement was traffic tickets

This was the third shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis since January 7, 2026, and the second fatality.

## Context: Federal Injunction on Chemical Irritants

On January 17, 2026, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez issued a preliminary injunction barring federal agents from using pepper spray on peaceful protesters and observers. The court found that chemical agents had been used against protesters on multiple occasions and that "protected conduct—including peaceful protesting and observation—had motivated the agents' actions."

This incident occurred seven days after that injunction was issued.

## Official Statements

### Governor Tim Walz

> "Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now."

### Mayor Jacob Frey

> "I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans, need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?"

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Shortal's own detailed account on her employer's news station, corroborated by multiple independent news outlets (TheWrap, FOX 9, CBS Minnesota). Video exists of aftermath. This follows the pattern of federal agents targeting press during Operation Metro Surge, in apparent violation of the January 17 federal injunction.
