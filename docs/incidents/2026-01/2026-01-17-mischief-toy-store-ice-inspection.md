# Toy Store Receives ICE Inspection Notice Hours After ABC News Interview

## Summary
Three hours after ABC News aired an interview with Mischief Toy Store owner Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall about distributing free ICE alert whistles, two plainclothes ICE agents arrived at the St. Paul store and served a Notice of Inspection requesting I-9 employment documents. The store's owners, who have been publicly critical of ICE operations, stated they had never received such an audit in 27 years of business.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Business:** Mischief Toy Store (legal name: Mischief LLC)
- **Owners:** Dan Marshall, Millie Adelsheim, Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall
- **Location:** 818 Grand Ave, St. Paul, Minnesota
- **Employees:** Five part-time employees and three owners
- **Background:** The store had been distributing free 3D-printed whistles for community members to alert neighbors when ICE agents are present. The owners have been publicly critical of ICE operations in the Twin Cities.

## Timeline
- **13:00 Friday** - ABC News airs interview with co-owner Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall about the store's distribution of ICE alert whistles
- **~16:00 Friday** - Two plainclothes ICE agents arrive at the store, approximately three hours after the broadcast
- **During visit** - Agents flash IDs and serve Notice of Inspection requesting I-9 employment verification documents
- **During visit** - Employee Ada Adelsheim (owner's daughter) was working; she did not photograph the agents' IDs
- **After visit** - Store posts photo of the inspection letter on social media
- **Saturday** - Store sells 250 anti-ICE yard signs in first three hours of opening; pledges $5,000 donation to local nonprofits

## What Happened
Two plainclothes ICE agents entered the toy store and presented identification before serving a Notice of Inspection. The inspection order requested I-9 documents, which verify employees' eligibility to work in the United States.

Owner Dan Marshall noted several irregularities:
- The notice listed the store by its trade name "Mischief Toy Store" rather than its legal entity name "Mischief LLC," which has been used on all other government documents
- Previous audits from government agencies arrived by mail, not via in-person agents
- In 27 years of operating as St. Paul retailers, the owners had never received an I-9 audit

The store's lawyer, who specializes in small business legal issues, told Marshall that numerous immigrant-owned businesses have also received similar audits.

## Context: First Amendment Activity
The inspection arrived three hours after ABC News broadcast an interview in which co-owner Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall discussed the store's distribution of free whistles to alert community members of ICE presence. The interview included criticism of ICE operations.

Dan Marshall stated: "She delivered a very strident anti-ICE message, which we're incredibly proud of. Three hours later, two plainclothes ICE agents came into our store and served us with a Notice of Inspection."

The store has been outspoken in opposition to both ICE and the Trump administration. In April, the store joined a lawsuit with other retailers and manufacturers against the U.S. government challenging international tariffs.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to the Twin Cities Pioneer Press request for comment.

### Store Response
Dan Marshall publicly questioned the timing and described the inspection as "harassment." The store declined a request not to publicize the inspection and instead shared the letter on social media.

Marshall stated: "We are a toy store that believes in social justice, and what ICE is doing, what Trump is doing in the Twin Cities is immoral and illegal."

Regarding the audit of their small staff, Marshall asked: "We have five part-time employees and three owners. So tell me why they want to waste time on five part-time employees."

Marshall stated: "This is an attempt to silence us and it's going to do the opposite."

### Community Response
Following the social media post:
- The ACLU reached out to the store
- Multiple elected officials contacted the owners
- Customer traffic increased significantly, described as comparable to the weekend before Christmas
- The store sold 250 anti-ICE yard signs in three hours on Saturday
- The store pledged to donate $5,000 to local nonprofits

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Detailed reporting from established local outlet (St. Paul Pioneer Press) with named sources (store owners Dan Marshall, Millie Adelsheim, Abigail Adelsheim-Marshall), direct quotes, and documented timeline. ABC News original broadcast provides additional corroboration. The three-hour gap between First Amendment protected speech on national television and the arrival of ICE agents is factual. ICE/DHS did not respond to request for comment.
