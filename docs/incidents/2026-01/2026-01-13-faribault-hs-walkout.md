# Over 100 Faribault High School Students Walk Out to Protest ICE

## Summary
Over 100 students at Faribault High School walked out at 12:30 p.m. to protest ICE operations in Minnesota, joining students at Roosevelt High School and schools across the state. Students carried homemade signs reading "abolish ICE," "no one is illegal on stolen land," and "ICE should be in my drinks, not my town."

## What Happened
At 12:30 p.m., over 100 students poured out of the front doors of Faribault High School to the front courtyard. Many students went to their cars to retrieve homemade signs with protest messages.

Principal Nate Molitor and other administrators emerged to observe and ensure safety.

## School's Response
The school sent an email to students, staff, and families the day before the walkout, alerting them that students were discussing the protest on social media.

**School statement excerpts:**
- "Students have the right to express their views in a safe and respectful manner that follows Faribault High School expectations"
- "It is the school's responsibility to maintain a safe environment"
- Academic standards would be upheld; absent students expected to make up schoolwork

## Context
The walkout occurred in the wake of:
- Increased ICE presence in Minnesota through "Operation Metro Surge"
- The shooting of U.S. citizen Renee Good on January 7
- ICE agents storming Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis on January 7
- Statewide student protests against ICE

## Significance
This incident demonstrates:
- ICE operations impacting Greater Minnesota school communities, not just Twin Cities
- Widespread student concern about immigration enforcement
- Rural Minnesota communities responding to ICE presence

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Local newspaper coverage of a community response event. While not a direct incident of ICE enforcement or civil rights violation, documents the impact of ICE operations on Greater Minnesota school communities.
