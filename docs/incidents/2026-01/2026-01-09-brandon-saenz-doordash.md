# DoorDash Driver Arrested by ICE; Wife Flees Into Customer's Home

## Summary
Brandon Steven Saenz was arrested by ICE agents when he and his wife arrived at a DoorDash delivery stop in Saint Paul. His wife fled into the customer's home seeking shelter, sparking a tense standoff that was captured on video. The homeowner, a Native American woman, demanded ICE produce a warrant before allowing entry. Police threatened to charge the homeowner with harboring. After a prolonged confrontation, the wife eventually exited and was not detained. The couple's child was in their vehicle during the incident. The wife has since obtained an immigration lawyer and is safe.

## Witness Accounts

### Wife's Statement (via update video)

## Context
This incident occurred approximately two days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in south Minneapolis on January 7, 2026, during a period of heightened ICE activity in the Twin Cities.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Primary documentation is through viral TikTok videos by the homeowner (@stormibabyy27) with corroborating updates identifying the affected individual by name (Brandon Steven Saenz). Multiple social media reposts and some minor international news coverage (IBTimes UK, Inkl). Video evidence exists showing the standoff at the home. The affected individual's name was confirmed in a follow-up post by @a.lyssa.lorencreations.

**Why MEDIUM (not HIGH):** This incident was not covered by any established news organizations (Fox 9, KARE 11, CBS Minnesota, Star Tribune, MPR News, etc.). All sources are social media posts or minor web outlets that aggregate viral content. While the video evidence is compelling and the affected individual is named, the lack of independent journalistic verification means we cannot confirm details beyond what appears in the videos and social media posts.
