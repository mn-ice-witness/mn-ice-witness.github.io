# Bovino Tells CNN Agents Are "The Victims" in Pretti Shooting; Says Second Amendment Rights "Don't Count"

## Summary
In a CNN "State of the Union" interview with Dana Bash the morning after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino claimed his agents were "the victims." When Bash pointed out that Bovino had repeatedly referred to Pretti as a "suspect" while defending the agents' actions, she said, "With respect, it feels as though in some ways you're blaming the victim here." Bovino replied: "The victim? The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I'm not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation." When Bash asked if exercising Second Amendment rights could result in being shot by federal law enforcement, Bovino stated: "We respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers."

## The Exchange

### On "Blaming the Victim"
When Dana Bash noted that Bovino kept referring to Pretti as a "suspect" while defending the agents:

> **Bash:** "With respect, it feels as though in some ways you're blaming the victim here."
>
> **Bovino:** "The victim? The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I'm not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation."

### On Second Amendment Rights
When Bash asked about Pretti's right to carry a firearm:

> **Bash:** "Are you saying it's not okay for him to exercise his Second Amendment right, not to mention his First Amendment right to be there in the first place, and if you do you can be shot by federal law enforcement?"
>
> **Bovino:** "No, I didn't say that, Dana. I never said that. What I'm saying is we respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers."

### On Evidence
Bash challenged Bovino's claims about Pretti's intentions:

> **Bash:** "All of the video that we have seen shows him documenting it with his cell phone, which is a lawful thing to do, and the only time he seemed to interact with law enforcement is when they went after him."

Video footage verified by the New York Times shows Pretti filming the scene with his phone. The analysis concludes that agents did not identify Pretti had a gun until about eight seconds after they had wrestled him to the ground.

## Reaction

Sam Stein, managing editor for The Bulwark, called it "one of the more Orwellian interviews I've seen in a long time on a Sunday show," adding that Bovino "basically asked you to just ignore your own eyes."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Interview broadcast live on CNN and documented by multiple news organizations. Direct quotes recorded on video.
