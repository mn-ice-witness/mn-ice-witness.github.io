# Two U.S. Citizen Target Employees Detained and Injured

## Summary
Two Target drive-up employees, both U.S. citizens, were aggressively detained by CBP agents at the Richfield Target store. Both sustained injuries. According to witnesses, agents asked the workers if they were citizens; when they didn't answer and tried to go inside, they were grabbed and pinned to the ground. One victim, a 22-year-old Latino man identified in court documents as "Javier Doe," had a knee pressed into his neck, was driven around in an SUV while agents played loud music, and was eventually dumped in a Walmart parking lot in Bloomington. He required emergency medical care and is now a plaintiff in the ACLU class-action lawsuit against ICE.

## Official Accounts

### DHS Statement
"This individual was arrested for assaulting federal law enforcement officers."

In response to ACLU lawsuit, DHS spokesperson called the allegations "disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE."

### Rep. Michael Howard (DFL-Richfield)
"Both are U.S. Citizens, clearly targeted because of the color of their skin. Both have now been released, but sustained injuries and untold trauma while their rights were trampled for no reason whatsoever."

### ACLU Statement
Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, staff attorney with ACLU of Minnesota: "ICE and CBP's practices are both illegal and morally reprehensible. Federal agents' conduct—sweeping up Minnesotans through racial profiling and unlawful arrests—is a grave violation of Minnesotans' most fundamental rights."

## Witness Accounts
Video shows large number of CBP agents approaching and entering Target. In the entranceway, agents pinned two men to ground who, according to witnesses, were drive-up employees. One man is heard shouting he's a U.S. citizen.

## Legal Action
Javier Doe is one of three plaintiffs in ACLU of Minnesota's class-action lawsuit filed January 15, 2026:
- **Case:** Filed in federal court
- **Defendants:** DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons
- **Relief sought:** Statewide injunction against racial profiling and excessive force

## Aftermath
- Protesters gathered at store demanding Target protect employees
- Pattern emerging of ICE targeting civilians at Twin Cities retail stores
- Target has remained silent on the incidents
- Javier Doe now ACLU lawsuit plaintiff

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence, multiple news sources (7+), statements from elected officials, ACLU federal lawsuit filing. Both victims confirmed as U.S. citizens by Rep. Howard who spoke with them directly. Javier Doe's account corroborated by lawsuit sworn allegations.
