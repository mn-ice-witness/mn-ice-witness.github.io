# Ecuadorean Man Held 3 Weeks Despite Court Order; Judge Orders ICE Director to Appear for Contempt

## Summary

Federal Judge Patrick Schiltz ordered ICE's acting director Todd Lyons to personally appear in court Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating court orders. The case stems from Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, an Ecuadorean man who entered the United States illegally in 1999 as a minor and has been in custody at Fort Snelling since January 6. Judge Schiltz ordered on January 14 that ICE allow Tobay Robles to challenge his detention at a hearing within a week or release him, finding ICE was holding him under an improper reading of federal law. ICE failed to comply. The judge, appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that his "patience is at an end" and that while summoning the ICE director was "an extraordinary step," it was necessary because "the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary."

## Affected Individual(s)

- **Name:** Juan Hugo Tobay Robles
- **Citizenship:** Ecuadorean, entered U.S. illegally in 1999 as a minor
- **Detention Location:** Fort Snelling, Minnesota
- **Status:** In custody since January 6, 2026; court found detention improper under federal law

## Timeline

- **Jan 6** - Tobay Robles detained by immigration agents.
- **Jan 14** - Judge Schiltz orders ICE to allow Tobay Robles to challenge detention at a hearing within one week, or release him; determines ICE is holding him under improper reading of federal law.
- **Jan 27 (evening)** - Judge Schiltz issues ruling summoning ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons to appear in court Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt
- **Jan 31 (Friday, 1:00 p.m.)** - Scheduled contempt hearing in Minneapolis (will be canceled if ICE releases Tobay Robles)

## Court Order Details

Judge Schiltz wrote that he had been "extremely patient" with ICE even though the agency had sent thousands of agents to Minnesota as part of President Trump's immigration crackdown without preparing for the legal challenges that "were sure to result."

The judge's order noted this case is "one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks." He wrote that the consequence of ICE's failures "has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong.)"

## Context

Judge Schiltz, who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, has emerged as an unlikely critic of the administration. Last Friday, he rejected a Justice Department request to reverse another judge's decision and issue arrest warrants for journalist Don Lemon and four others connected to a church protest in St. Paul, calling the department's request "frivolous" and "unprecedented."
