# DHS Secretary Noem Defends Raids as Targeting 'Criminals and Rapists,' Denies Pepper Spray Use on CBS

## Summary
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denied on CBS's "Face the Nation" that federal agents had used pepper spray and similar tactics curtailed by a judicial order, claiming the judge "told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing." When confronted with video evidence, she backtracked and blamed protesters, saying agents "only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening."

## Timeline
- **Jan 17, 2026** - Federal Judge Katherine Menendez issues preliminary injunction barring federal agents from using pepper spray on peaceful protesters
- **Jan 18, morning** - Noem appears on CBS "Face the Nation" with Margaret Brennan
- **During interview** - Noem claims judge's order was "a little ridiculous" and "didn't change anything"
- **During interview** - CBS shows video evidence of chemical agent use
- **During interview** - Noem backtracks, blames protesters for the use of force

## Official Statement

### Initial Denial
When asked about the federal court order restricting chemical agent use, Noem stated:

> "That federal order was a little ridiculous, because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing."

> "That judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing."

### The Backtrack
After CBS showed video evidence backing up accounts provided to the court, Noem changed course and blamed protesters:

> "We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe."

## Fact Check

### Judge Menendez's Findings
The federal court found that chemical agents were used against protesters on at least four separate occasions. Judge Menendez ruled that the evidence of chemical agent use was "uncontroverted" and rejected government claims that all such deployments occurred only after agents were attacked.

The court determined that "protected conduct—including peaceful protesting and observation—had motivated the agents' actions" and that federal agents deployed substances to punish protesters exercising "protected First Amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations."

### CBS Polling Data
In polling released alongside the interview:
- 53% of Americans say recent Minneapolis events make them think ICE operations should be decreased
- 61% of Americans describe ICE's detention tactics as "too tough" (up from 56% in November)

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Primary source is the official CBS transcript and video of the interview. Noem's statements and the subsequent backtrack when confronted with evidence are documented on the record. Judge Menendez's ruling provides independent verification that chemical agents were used against peaceful protesters.
