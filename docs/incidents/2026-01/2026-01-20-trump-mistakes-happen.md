## Official Statement

### Trump on ICE "Mistakes"
At the White House briefing on January 20, 2026, Trump stated:

> "They're going to make mistakes sometimes. ICE is going to be too rough with somebody, or, you know, they deal with rough people. They're going to make a mistake. Sometimes it can happen. We feel terribly."

Referring to the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Trump said he "felt horribly" when he heard about her death, calling it "a tragedy" and "a horrible thing."

### Emphasis on "Murderers and Drug Dealers"
In response to questions about enforcement concerns, Trump displayed criminal histories of those apprehended during Minnesota operations. Standing at the briefing room podium, he flipped through pages of arrest records and stated:

> "They don't say it like they should. They're apprehending murderers and drug dealers, a lot of bad people."

On social media, Trump emphasized:

> "The Department of Homeland Security and ICE must start talking about the murderers and other criminals."

Trump lauded ICE for allegedly arresting "tens of thousands of illegal alien gang members, drug dealers, murderers, drug runners, human traffickers, fraudsters, and savage criminals."

## Context

### Administration Messaging on Criminal Enforcement
Trump's rhetoric mirrors DHS Secretary Noem's consistent messaging, which emphasizes "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens, including pedophiles, murderers, gang members, terrorists, and rapists."

Available data on ICE detainees:
- **74% of nearly 70,000 immigrants in detention have no criminal convictions** (ICE detention statistics, December 2025)
- According to CNN internal ICE statistics, **less than 10% of immigrants in ICE custody since October 2024 had criminal offenses**
- The Cato Institute reported **65% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, and 93% had no violent convictions**

### Documented Enforcement Incidents

Civil rights organizations and critics have cited the following patterns:

**1. Observers and Protesters**
The ACLU's class-action lawsuit (*Hussen v. Noem*) alleges suspicionless stops and warrantless arrests based on perceived ethnicity. U.S. citizens have been detained while filming operations.

**2. Citizenship Checks**
Multiple documented incidents involve U.S. citizens stopped and questioned based on appearance, accent, or proximity to enforcement operations.

**3. Use of Force Concerns**
Former DOJ Civil Rights Division attorneys wrote that Renee Good's death was "a predictable one," citing "countless videos of ICE officers using force that reflected poor training, a refusal to de-escalate and a growing corps of masked agents acting with brutal impunity." They characterized the shooting as "textbook excessive force."

**4. Individuals with Legal Status**
The deportation of individuals with legal status—including Kilmar Abrego García (had withholding of removal protection) and Any Lucia Lopez Belloza (legal student)—has raised questions about enforcement scope. As one analyst noted: "These were legal pathways. People did the thing the government asked them to do, and this government went and preemptively revoked that status."

### Statements from Civil Rights Organizations

**Human Rights Watch** documented 13 policies of concern in its first-year review, noting that ICE detention reached 68,400 people in December 2025—a record high—with mandatory detention policies eliminating bond hearings for many immigrants.

**The NAACP and coalition partners** wrote to Congress regarding DHS funding, citing "record-high deaths in custody, wrongful detention of U.S. citizens, lack of transparency, expansion of dragnet surveillance, and the misuse of military resources in civilian immigration enforcement."

**National Urban League President Mark Morial** characterized the situation as a "state of emergency," stating the country "is creeping toward totalitarianism."

### Additional Context

Related policy and enforcement questions raised by observers:
- DHS policy explicitly authorizes "collateral" arrests of individuals encountered coincidentally
- DOJ declined to investigate the Renee Good shooting; six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned in response
- 74% of detainees have no criminal record according to ICE detention statistics

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Primary source video and official White House briefing covered by multiple major outlets. Trump's quotes are widely reported and consistent across sources. Context draws on documented ICE statistics, federal lawsuit filings, and published commentary from former DOJ Civil Rights Division attorneys.
