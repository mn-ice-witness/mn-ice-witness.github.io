## Official Accounts

### DHS Statement
Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated officers were conducting surveillance "on a known illegal alien target" when "agitators began to obstruct law enforcement." The statement also claimed "an agitator's reckless driving caused officer to get in a car wreck."

### Disputed Claims
Witnesses dispute an ICE agent's claim that his vehicle was "rammed."

## Witness Accounts

### Breanna Evans, Co-Owner of Wrecktangle Pizza
- "They stormed up on our door to try to get in."
- "We probably put a target on ourselves like that by helping people, which is sickening."
- "Minneapolis strong community first...you can see what happens when they try to mess with us."

(Evans was interviewed on KARE11 6PM News on January 14, 2026)

## Context
The visit came after Wrecktangle Pizza's highly publicized fundraising campaign that raised over $83,000 for nonprofits supporting those affected by increased ICE enforcement. The restaurant also donated pizzas—one for each customer's purchase—for people impacted by the immigration crackdown. Co-owner Evans suggested this charitable work may have made them a target.

## Community Response
Following the incident, nearby businesses like Smitten Kitten began collecting donations (food and household goods) for immigrants unable to leave their homes. Community members stood guard outside businesses watching for ICE activity.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent sources (CBS Minnesota, Bring Me The News, Racket MN, Daily Planet). Surveillance video evidence. Named source (co-owner Breanna Evans) with direct quotes. DHS official statement provides federal account.
