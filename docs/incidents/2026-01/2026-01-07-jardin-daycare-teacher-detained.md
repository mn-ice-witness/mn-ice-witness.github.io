## Affected Individual(s)
- **Occupation:** Teacher at Jardin Spanish Immersion Academy
- **Work authorization:** Valid work permit through 2030
- **Criminal record:** None indicated
- **Current status:** Unknown; had not been released as of Jan 16

## What Happened
- Several ICE agents in tactical gear arrived at a Jardin Spanish Immersion Academy branch in Minneapolis
- Agents removed the teacher from her car directly outside the daycare as she was about to start work
- Parents dropping off children pulled to the side of the road and blew whistles to alert others
- Bystander video captured the detention
- Parents created a GoFundMe page to help with her legal efforts

## Community Response
Parents at Jardin and other Twin Cities daycares have organized to:
- Stand watch for ICE outside child care centers
- Escort staff to and from vehicles
- Raise money for at-risk staff members
- Alert each other through group chats about ICE activity

## Context
This detention occurred on the same day as the fatal shooting of Renee Good and the Border Patrol incident at Roosevelt High School. The Trump administration has repeatedly said it does not target daycares or schools, but multiple incidents involving educators have been documented.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Star Tribune viewed bystander video but did not verify teacher's identity. Multiple parents confirmed detention. GoFundMe page provides work permit details. No official statement from Jardin or ICE. Teacher's name and current location not confirmed.
