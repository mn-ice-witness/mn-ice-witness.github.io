## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Eyewitness account from credible local journalist with video evidence. Corroborated by Racket's written reporting. However, mainstream news outlets did not separately report on this specific vehicle incident amid the larger coverage of the Renee Good shooting and subsequent protests. The video exists on Bluesky but has not been independently analyzed by major outlets.
