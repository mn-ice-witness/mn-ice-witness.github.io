# DHS Subpoenas Hennepin Healthcare Employee Records for 7,000+ Workers

## Summary
The Department of Homeland Security issued a subpoena to Hennepin Healthcare on January 8, 2026, demanding I-9 employment verification forms for more than 7,000 employees. The subpoena came less than a week after county commissioners and legislators confronted ICE agents who had shackled a patient at HCMC for 28 hours without a warrant. County Commissioner Angela Conley called the audit a "retaliatory move."

## Details

### What Was Subpoenaed
- I-9 employment verification forms for 7,000+ employees
- Forms contain: home addresses, Social Security numbers, employment eligibility status
- Hennepin Healthcare operates Minnesota's largest Level One adult and pediatric trauma center

### Timeline of Events
- **Dec 31, 2025** - ICE agents enter HCMC, shackle patient to bed for 28 hours without warrant
- **Jan 6, 2026** - County Commissioner Angela Conley, legislators, and Unidos MN hold press conference at HCMC blasting ICE conduct
- **Jan 8, 2026** - DHS issues subpoena for employee records (2 days after public criticism)
- **Jan 15, 2026** - Hennepin County Board votes unanimously to condemn ICE and call for removal from Minnesota

### Retaliation Concerns
County Commissioner Angela Conley explicitly called the employment audit a "retaliatory move" at a press conference with other local elected leaders. The subpoena was issued just two days after officials publicly criticized ICE's hospital conduct.

### Legal Context
Employment attorney Phyllis Karasov explained that hospitals lack discretion in compliance: "There are monetary penalties for refusing to provide the information" and potential additional penalties for knowingly employing unauthorized workers. Hennepin Healthcare stated it is complying because failure to do so "could result in criminal or civil penalties."

### Constitutional Concerns
- **4th Amendment** - Mass seizure of personal data (SSNs, addresses) for 7,000+ workers without individualized suspicion
- **1st Amendment** - Potential retaliation against institution whose officials exercised free speech by criticizing ICE
- **Chilling Effect** - Hospital workers report being "afraid to come to work" since subpoena was issued

### Broader Context
Hennepin Healthcare is not alone - immigration attorney Michael Davis told the Star Tribune he's handling several I-9 subpoena cases per week when he would normally see a handful per year. DHS is issuing a "torrent of subpoenas" to small and medium-sized businesses for employment records as part of Operation Metro Surge.

## Official Accounts

### Hennepin Healthcare Statement
"The agency is legally authorized to inspect this information." The organization confirmed it is complying with the subpoena.

### County Commissioner Angela Conley
Called the audit a "retaliatory move" in a press conference.
