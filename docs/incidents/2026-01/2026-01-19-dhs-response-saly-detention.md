# DHS Response: Defends Detention of Hmong Citizen, Claims Sex Offender Targets at Large — Family Disputes as "False"

## Summary
A DHS response posted on X defends the detention of a U.S. citizen (ChongLy Scott Thao) at his St. Paul home, claiming ICE was conducting a "targeted operation" for two convicted sex offenders who "remain at large." The statement claims the citizen "refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd" and "matched the description of the targets."

**The same day, the family issued a formal press release categorically disputing DHS claims as false.** The family states that no other men live at the home (only Mr. Thao, his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson), that they don't know the individuals DHS references, that no warrant was presented, and that ICE agents forcibly entered with weapons drawn without asking for identification. The family has filed complaints with the ACLU of Minnesota and Minnesota AG Keith Ellison.

## Official Statement

Full statement from Tricia McLaughlin, DHS Assistant Secretary (@TriciaOhio):

> Yesterday in St. Paul, ICE conducted a targeted operation of 2 convicted sex offenders. One of the criminal targets had convictions for sex with a minor and sexual assault. The other target had convictions for sex assault with penetration in the first degree, domestic violence, and violating a protective order. Both also have convictions for failure to register as sex offenders. They both have final orders of removal from an immigration judge.
>
> The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation. The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement.
>
> Both of these sexual predators remain AT LARGE in St. Paul. We will be providing the public with photos and descriptors to help us locate and apprehend these public safety threats.

## Family Rebuttal (January 19, 2026)

On the same day, the family issued a formal press release categorically disputing DHS claims. Immigration policy expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) shared the statement on X, writing: "NEW: the family of the elderly US citizen dragged out of his house by ICE in his underwear when it was 12 degrees and snowing says in a statement that @TriciaOhio's claims are FALSE. They say no other men live at the house (only his family) and that NO WARRANT was ever shown."

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - January 19, 2026**
**Family Statement Correcting DHS Claims – ChongLy Scott Thao**
**Spokesperson: Louansee Moua, ChongLy Scott Thao Family**

> The family of ChongLy Scott Thao categorically disputes the Department of Homeland Security's public statement regarding the ICE operation conducted on January 18, 2026, in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
>
> Mr. Thao is a United States citizen with no criminal record. He does not live with, nor has he ever lived with, the individuals DHS claims were targets of this operation. The only people residing at the home are Mr. Thao, his son, his daughter-in-law, and his young grandson.
>
> They do not know the individuals DHS references.
>
> ICE agents did not present a warrant, did not ask for identification, and nevertheless forcibly entered the home with weapons drawn. Mr. Thao went willingly with ICE, despite knowing he had done nothing wrong.
>
> During the operation, Mr. Thao was removed from his home wearing only underwear in approximately 12-degree weather, in full view of his family and neighbors. He suffers from severe psoriasis, a serious medical condition that is exacerbated by extreme cold and stress. This treatment was unnecessary, degrading, and deeply traumatizing.
>
> The family strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims. These statements have caused additional harm to a family already struggling to recover from a terrifying and unjustified encounter.
>
> The family is actively pursuing legal representation and has filed complaints with the ACLU of Minnesota and the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Due to the ongoing legal process, no further comment will be made at this time.

## Analysis

### Source Attribution
The statement was posted by Tricia McLaughlin (@TriciaOhio), Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, making this an official federal government response.

### DHS Claims vs. Family Rebuttal

| DHS Claim (@TriciaOhio) | Family Statement (Louansee Moua) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders" | "He does not live with, nor has he ever lived with, the individuals DHS claims" - only Mr. Thao, his son, daughter-in-law, and young grandson reside at the home |
| "They do not know the individuals DHS references" | Family explicitly states they don't know who DHS is referring to |
| "The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd" | "Mr. Thao went willingly with ICE, despite knowing he had done nothing wrong" |
| Standard protocol to hold individuals | "ICE agents did not present a warrant, did not ask for identification, and nevertheless forcibly entered the home with weapons drawn" |
| (No mention of treatment) | "Mr. Thao was removed from his home wearing only underwear in approximately 12-degree weather" and suffers from severe psoriasis |

### Key Contradictions
1. **Living arrangement:** DHS claims the citizen lives with two sex offenders; family says only immediate family (son, daughter-in-law, grandson) reside there
2. **Knowledge of targets:** Family states they don't know the individuals DHS references
3. **Cooperation:** DHS claims citizen refused ID; family says he went willingly
4. **Warrant:** DHS implies standard operation; family explicitly states NO warrant was presented
5. **Treatment:** DHS statement omits the conditions of detention; family documents underwear-only detention in 12-degree weather

### Legal Action
The family has filed complaints with:
- ACLU of Minnesota
- Office of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison

### Unresolved Questions
- No photos or descriptors of the alleged sex offenders have been released by DHS
- No warrant has been produced to support the operation
- No explanation for why the citizen was driven around for an hour

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official statement from Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, paired with formal family press release disputing all key claims. Both are primary sources providing directly conflicting accounts. The family rebuttal specifically addresses and disputes: (1) that sex offenders live at the home, (2) that the citizen refused identification, and (3) that a warrant was presented. The family has initiated formal complaints with the ACLU of Minnesota and MN Attorney General Keith Ellison. This incident now represents a matter of disputed fact between federal officials and the affected family.
