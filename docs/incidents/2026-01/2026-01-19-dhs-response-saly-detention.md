# DHS Response: Defends Detention of Hmong Citizen, Claims Sex Offender Targets at Large

## Summary
A response posted on X defends the detention of a U.S. citizen (Saly) at his St. Paul apartment, claiming ICE was conducting a "targeted operation" for two convicted sex offenders who "remain at large." The statement claims the citizen "refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd" and "matched the description of the targets." It confirms he was held during the operation before being released.

## Sources
1. X Post (Jan 19, 2026): [@TriciaOhio statement](https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/2013317071342317918) - Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary, Department of Homeland Security

## Official Statement

Full statement from Tricia McLaughlin, DHS Assistant Secretary (@TriciaOhio):

> Yesterday in St. Paul, ICE conducted a targeted operation of 2 convicted sex offenders. One of the criminal targets had convictions for sex with a minor and sexual assault. The other target had convictions for sex assault with penetration in the first degree, domestic violence, and violating a protective order. Both also have convictions for failure to register as sex offenders. They both have final orders of removal from an immigration judge.
>
> The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation. The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement.
>
> Both of these sexual predators remain AT LARGE in St. Paul. We will be providing the public with photos and descriptors to help us locate and apprehend these public safety threats.

## Analysis

### Source Attribution
The statement was posted by Tricia McLaughlin (@TriciaOhio), Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, making this an official federal government response.

### Claims vs. Family Account
The statement introduces several new claims:
1. **Sex offenders:** Claims ICE was targeting two convicted sex offenders at the address
2. **Living arrangement:** Claims the citizen "lives with" the targets
3. **Refused ID:** Claims the citizen "refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd"
4. **Matched description:** Claims he "matched the description of the targets"

### Contradictions with Family Account
The family account states:
- ICE broke down the door and "trashed the place"
- A gun was pointed at the daughter-in-law's head
- Saly was not allowed to dress before being taken outside in freezing weather
- He was fingerprinted during the encounter (contradicting claim he "refused")
- ICE drove him around for nearly an hour before releasing him
- Family believes ICE was looking for someone who "previously lived there"

### Unresolved Questions
- The statement does not address the treatment described by family (breaking door, gun pointed at family member, taken outside shirtless in freezing weather)
- No photos or descriptors of the alleged sex offenders have been released
- No explanation for why the citizen was driven around for an hour if this was standard "holding" protocol

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official statement from Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Primary source government response that confirms key details (citizen detained, released after verification) while introducing new claims about the targets of the operation.
