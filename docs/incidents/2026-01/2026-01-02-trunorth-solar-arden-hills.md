## What Happened
ICE agents descended on the TruNorth Solar factory in Arden Hills in what was described as the first major workplace raid of 2026. The raid occurred five days before the January 7 shooting of Renee Good that would dramatically escalate tensions.

## Community Response
Protesters:
- Blew whistles
- Honked horns
- Yelled at agents to leave the facility

## Context
This raid was part of "Operation Metro Surge" which the DHS described as targeting alleged fraud at child care facilities. The operation brought thousands of federal agents to the Twin Cities area starting in December 2025.

By January 7, 2026, DHS reported arresting 150 people since the surge began, with more than 2,000 agents deployed to Minnesota.

## Related Incidents
This factory raid preceded the escalation of enforcement that led to:
- The January 7 shooting of Renee Good
- Multiple clashes between protesters and federal agents
- The state of Minnesota lawsuit against DHS

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Limited sourcing for this specific incident (no mainstream local news coverage found). However, the raid is consistent with documented "Operation Metro Surge" activity. More details may emerge as reporting continues.
