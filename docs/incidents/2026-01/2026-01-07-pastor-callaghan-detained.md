# White Pastor Detained, Told He Was Released Because "You're White. You Wouldn't Be Fun Anyway"

## Summary
Rev. Kenny Callaghan, a Minneapolis pastor, was detained by ICE agents on January 7, 2026, the same day Renee Good was shot and killed. After positioning himself beside a Hispanic woman to protect her from agents, Callaghan was handcuffed at gunpoint and placed in an SUV for 30 minutes. Upon release, agents told him: "Well, you're White. You wouldn't be fun anyway." The incident has been cited as evidence of racial profiling in ICE operations.

## Analysis
This incident is significant for several reasons:
1. **Explicit racial profiling** - Agent's statement explicitly references race as factor in release decision
2. **Use of fear/intimidation** - Repeated questioning "Are you afraid yet?" suggests intimidation tactics
3. **Gun pointed at U.S. citizen** - Callaghan had a firearm aimed at his face despite being a non-threatening observer
4. **Contrast with treatment of non-white detainees** - Comment implies different treatment for people of color

## Pastor's Reflection
Callaghan stated that the experience revealed how ICE operations use "fear and intimidation," though he emphasized his commitment to continuing protest work and advocating for marginalized communities.
