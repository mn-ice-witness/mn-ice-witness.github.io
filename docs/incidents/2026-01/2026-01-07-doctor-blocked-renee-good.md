# ICE Blocks Physician From Helping Shooting Victim

## Summary
After ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Good, a bystander who identified himself as a physician attempted to provide medical assistance. ICE agents refused to let him near the victim. When the bystander said "I'm a physician," an agent replied "I don't care." Agents claimed they had their own medics on the way, but witness Emily Heller reported it was at least 15 minutes before an ambulance arrived. ICE vehicles abandoned at the scene blocked the ambulance's access.

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Unidentified physician (bystander)
- **Citizenship:** Unknown (U.S. citizen implied)
- **Role:** Attempted to provide emergency medical care

## The Exchange (from video)
- **Physician:** "Can I check a pulse?"
- **Agent:** "No, back up now!"
- **Physician:** "I'm a physician!"
- **Agent:** "I don't care."
- **Other agents:** Claimed EMS was on the way and they had their own medics

## Witness Account

**Emily Heller (recorded the video):**
> "Yeah, they wouldn't let him near. And they said they had their own medics that were on their way, which it was — it was, I mean, I don't know, it was at least 15 minutes before the ambulance arrived."

Heller told CNN the ambulance couldn't get through because vehicles "abandoned" by the ICE agents on scene were blocking the road.

## Medical Response Failures
- Agents waited 3 minutes to call 911 after the shooting
- After brief medical assessment, agents left Good bleeding in her car
- When emergency responders arrived, Good was "unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity"
- ICE agents are trained in CPR but did not perform it on Good

## Legal Analysis

**Alexa Van Brunt (MacArthur Justice Center):**
> "What is so disturbing about that scene is that they were denying access to somebody who was a physician, so [someone] who obviously had at least suggested that they had the qualifications and the ability to help in an emergency, while not seemingly providing any medical care themselves. It really seems unlawful, a violation of law, I'm sure a violation of ICE standards and training."

**Professor Ayesha Bell Hardaway:**
> "The failure of the agents to follow stated policy is one that should not be overlooked. Minneapolis and many other jurisdictions have revised their police policies to include a duty to render aid immediately after a use of deadly force incident."

## Context
This refusal to allow bystander medical assistance echoes the restraint-related death of George Floyd, where bystander offers to help were also denied.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence exists from multiple angles. Multiple independent news outlets reported on the incident. Legal experts have analyzed the implications. The exchange is documented on video with clear audio.
