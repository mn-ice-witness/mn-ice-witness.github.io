# Metro Police Chiefs Call for End to Racially Discriminatory Citizen Checks

## Summary
Three Twin Cities law enforcement leaders held a joint press conference at the Minnesota State Capitol on January 20 to address a pattern of ICE agents conducting racially discriminatory citizenship checks on people of color. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley stated his department has received "endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from US citizens" over the previous two weeks, with citizens being stopped without cause and forced to show paperwork. Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt called the incidents "concrete examples of profiling." St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry said "people are scared to death, afraid to go outside."

## Official Accounts

### Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley
"Recently, as the last two weeks, we as law enforcement community have been receiving endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from US citizens. What we're hearing is they're being stopped in traffic stops or on the street with no cause and being forced to show paperwork to determine if they are here legally."

"Every one of these individuals is a person of color... it has to stop."

Bruley noted that accountability for federal agents' alleged abuses remains difficult because ICE officers cover their faces and do not display badges to identify themselves. He stated he believes the racial profiling is being carried out by a small subset of federal agents.

### Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt
Called the incidents "concrete examples of profiling."

### St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry
"People are scared to death, afraid to go outside—not because their status is in question but because they know people get stopped based on appearance."

### DHS/ICE Statement
No statement found addressing these specific allegations.

## Broader Context
The ACLU of Minnesota filed a class-action lawsuit against federal authorities alleging suspicionless stops and ethnic-based detention. DHS has deployed approximately 3,000 ICE and Border Patrol agents to Minnesota under "Operation Metro Surge," claiming 3,000 arrests over six weeks.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - This response is documented through a formal press conference by three law enforcement officials: Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, and St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry. The press conference was covered by multiple major news outlets (KSTP, KARE 11, Raw Story, Alternet, CBS Minnesota, Fox News, Washington Post, Fox 9). The involvement of three separate law enforcement agencies lending credibility to citizen complaints establishes strong institutional corroboration of a pattern of racial profiling.
