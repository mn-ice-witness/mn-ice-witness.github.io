## Victim Statement

### Elliott Payne
"If this is how they treat the President of the Minneapolis City Council who is legally observing, just think of what they're doing to everyone else in our City."

## Context
The incident occurred as Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis, filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to end the surge of ICE agents. Ellison noted the number of ICE agents in the Twin Cities (~2,000) surpasses the combined police forces of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence shared by victim (elected official). Multiple news outlets covered. Clear documentation of treatment of legal observers.
