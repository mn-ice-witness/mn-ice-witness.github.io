# Bovino Blames Politicians, Community Leaders, and Journalists for "Tragic Consequences"

## Summary
At a press conference the day after Alex Pretti was fatally shot by federal agents, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino blamed politicians, community leaders, and journalists for what he called "tragic consequences." Bovino stated that those who "vilify law enforcement" by calling agents "Gestapo" bear responsibility for "consequences" and "what we saw yesterday" — an apparent reference to the Pretti shooting — though he never explicitly articulated how criticism of law enforcement caused the shooting. When asked directly if DHS would take responsibility for the fatal shootings, Bovino declined to answer.

## Key Statements

### On Journalists and "Vilification"
> "When politicians, community leaders and some journalists engage in that heated rhetoric we keep talking about, when they make the choice to vilify law enforcement, calling law enforcement names like Gestapo or using the term kidnapping, that is a choice that has made their actions and consequences that come from those choices."

### On "So-Called Journalists" and Consequences
> "When someone chooses to listen to a politician, a **so-called journalist**, or a community leader that spouts that type of vilification towards law enforcement or anything else… there are consequences and actions there also, **I think we saw that yesterday.**"

### On "Tragic Consequences"
> "Those actions and choices can obviously have **tragic consequences**, bad outcomes, outcomes that law enforcement never wants to see. Law enforcement never wants to see a bad consequence due to a poor choice."

## Analysis

### What Bovino Implies But Does Not State
Bovino's remarks draw a causal chain between:
1. Critics calling agents "Gestapo" or using terms like "kidnapping"
2. People "choosing to listen" to those critics
3. "Tragic consequences" and "what we saw yesterday" (the Pretti shooting)

However, Bovino never explicitly articulates the mechanism by which criticism of law enforcement leads to a fatal shooting by federal agents. The logical gap in the argument is left unstated.

### Deflection of Responsibility
When asked directly if he or DHS would take responsibility for the fatal shootings, Bovino declined to answer the question. Instead, he referred to Pretti and Renee Good as "suspects" who "assault, delay, obstruct or threaten a law enforcement officer's life."

> "It goes back to the choices that we just talked about when individuals make poor choices, poor decisions, come into a law enforcement situation, an active law enforcement situation conspire to come into that situation."

### The "Gestapo" Reference
Bovino specifically cited being called "Gestapo" as an example of harmful rhetoric. This term has been used by critics in reference to:
- His distinctive long army-green overcoat, which drew comparisons to SS uniforms
- California Governor Gavin Newsom's comment that Bovino "literally went on eBay and purchased SS garb"
- Viral social media posts comparing his appearance to Heinrich Himmler

## Context

This press conference occurred one day after Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was fatally shot by federal agents. Video footage showed:
- Pretti filming agents and intervening when agents shoved several women
- Pretti being maced, wrestled to the ground, and struck repeatedly
- Pretti being shot while on the ground
- Pretti had a legal concealed carry permit but video shows he never drew his weapon

At the same press conference, Bovino claimed — without evidence — that Pretti intended to "massacre" federal agents and inflict "maximum damage."

## Subsequent Developments

- **January 26, 2026:** Bovino was removed from his role in Minneapolis
- **January 26, 2026:** Border czar Tom Homan was sent to take over operations
- **January 27, 2026:** Reports indicated Bovino may retire

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Bovino's statements documented in video and reported by multiple news organizations including Yahoo News, The Hill, Salon, and AOL. Direct quotes recorded on video at press conference.
