We are still seeking verification of the date and the underlying claim about ICE distributing food support flyers. If you have any information, please [contact us](mailto:mnicewitness@proton.me).***

## Summary
A screenshot circulating on social media shows an announcement from [Sullivan Elementary](https://sullivan.mpschools.org/) in Minneapolis warning families that ICE is distributing flyers offering food support to families. The school advises families not to respond to these offers "for your safety" and directs those in need to contact the school's social workers instead. The date of the announcement is unknown.

## Context: ICE Ruse Tactics

The [Immigrant Defense Project](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/ice-ruses/) has documented ICE using various ruses since 2017, including:
- Pretending to be local police
- Claiming to investigate fake crimes
- Using plainclothes officers with vests marked "POLICE"

However, we found no documented cases of ICE specifically using food assistance flyers as a lure.

## Context: Fake ICE Messages

[Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina](https://www.wral.com/news/education/nash-county-schools-fake-ice-message-feb-2025/) warned in February 2025 about fraudulent messages designed to look like official school communications that spread false information about ICE activity. Schools have been combating misinformation alongside genuine safety concerns.
