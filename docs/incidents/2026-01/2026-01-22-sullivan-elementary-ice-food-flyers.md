# School Warns ICE Distributing Food Support Flyers (UNVERIFIED)

***The school sent this warning, but did ICE actually distribute flyers? No one has produced a flyer or described receiving one. If you have seen these flyers or know how the school learned about them, please [contact us](mailto:mnicewitness@proton.me).***

## Summary

The school warning is real, but we don't know if ICE actually distributed flyers. Anne Sullivan STEAM School sent a message on Jan 22, 2026 claiming ICE is distributing food flyers—but no flyer has been produced, no one has described receiving one, and no journalist has confirmed ICE did this. We need: an actual flyer, or anyone who received/saw one.

## The School Message

The message read:

> "Hello Sullivan Families, we have learned that ICE is sending out flyers offering food support to families. For your safety, do not respond to these offers. If your family is in need of support, please contact the school and we will connect you with one of our School Social Workers."

## What IS Verified

- **The school message exists**: Multiple sources confirm Anne Sullivan STEAM School sent this message via TalkingPoints on January 22, 2026
- **The message is authentic**: According to reporting, it was "confirmed by the school's administration"
- **The source**: Steve McPherson, a Minneapolis-based writer ([@steventurous.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/steventurous.bsky.social)), shared the message on Bluesky, stating it came from the middle school's Signal chat
- **The school is real**: Anne Sullivan STEAM School is part of Minneapolis Public Schools

## The Key Unknown: Did ICE Actually Do This?

**We do not know if ICE actually distributed any flyers.** We only know the school sent a warning claiming they did.

- **No one has produced, photographed, or described an actual flyer** - not a single flyer has been shown to journalists or the public
- **We don't know how the school learned about the flyers** - did a parent report receiving one? Did someone see them being distributed? The school's message says "we have learned" but doesn't say how
- **No major Minnesota media has independently investigated the flyer claim** - MPR mentioned the warning in broader coverage, but no outlet has confirmed ICE actually distributed flyers
- **No official Minneapolis Public Schools statement** beyond the TalkingPoints message
- **No ICE/DHS response** confirming or denying

## Sources

The story has been covered by partisan/advocacy media. Some mainstream outlets mention the school warning in broader ICE/schools coverage, but none have independently investigated whether ICE actually distributed flyers:

## Context: ICE Ruse Tactics

The [Immigrant Defense Project](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/ice-ruses/) has documented ICE using various ruses since 2017, including:
- Pretending to be local police
- Claiming to investigate fake crimes
- Using plainclothes officers with vests marked "POLICE"

However, we found no documented cases of ICE specifically using food assistance flyers as a lure.

## Context: Fake ICE Messages

[Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina](https://www.wral.com/news/education/nash-county-schools-fake-ice-message-feb-2025/) warned in February 2025 about fraudulent messages designed to look like official school communications that spread false information about ICE activity. Schools have been combating misinformation alongside genuine safety concerns.

## Editorial Assessment

**UNVERIFIED** - The school sent this warning, but we have no evidence ICE actually distributed any flyers. No flyer has been produced. No one has described receiving one. No journalist has confirmed the claim.
