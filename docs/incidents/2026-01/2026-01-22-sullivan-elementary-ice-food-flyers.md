# School Warns ICE Distributing Food Support Flyers (UNVERIFIED)

***The school message appears to be authentic, but the underlying claim that ICE is distributing food flyers has NOT been independently verified by any journalist or official source. If you have any information—especially photos of the actual flyers—please [contact us](mailto:mnicewitness@proton.me).***

## Summary

School message is verified; underlying claim about ICE flyers is NOT. Anne Sullivan STEAM School sent a warning via TalkingPoints on Jan 22, 2026, but no journalist has seen the alleged flyers and no major Minnesota media has covered this story. We need: photos of the flyers, or independent confirmation ICE distributed them.

## The School Message

The message read:

> "Hello Sullivan Families, we have learned that ICE is sending out flyers offering food support to families. For your safety, do not respond to these offers. If your family is in need of support, please contact the school and we will connect you with one of our School Social Workers."

## What IS Verified

- **The school message exists**: Multiple sources confirm Anne Sullivan STEAM School sent this message via TalkingPoints on January 22, 2026
- **The message is authentic**: According to reporting, it was "confirmed by the school's administration"
- **The source**: Steve McPherson, a Minneapolis-based writer ([@steventurous.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/steventurous.bsky.social)), shared the message on Bluesky, stating it came from the middle school's Signal chat
- **The school is real**: Anne Sullivan STEAM School is part of Minneapolis Public Schools

## What is NOT Verified

- **No journalist has seen or photographed the alleged ICE flyers**
- **No major Minnesota media has covered this story** (Star Tribune, MPR News, KARE11, KSTP, WCCO, Fox9 have not reported on the flyer claim)
- **No official Minneapolis Public Schools statement** about ICE flyers has been published
- **No ICE/DHS response** to this specific allegation
- **The flyers themselves have not been described in detail** - we don't know what they look like, what they say, or where they were distributed
- **We don't know who reported the flyers to the school** or how the school learned about them

## Media Coverage

The story has been covered by partisan/advocacy media but not by mainstream Minnesota outlets:

This occurred during [Operation Metro Surge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Metro_Surge), a major ICE enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Related verified coverage includes:

## Context: ICE Ruse Tactics

The [Immigrant Defense Project](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/ice-ruses/) has documented ICE using various ruses since 2017, including:
- Pretending to be local police
- Claiming to investigate fake crimes
- Using plainclothes officers with vests marked "POLICE"

However, we found no documented cases of ICE specifically using food assistance flyers as a lure.

## Context: Fake ICE Messages

[Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina](https://www.wral.com/news/education/nash-county-schools-fake-ice-message-feb-2025/) warned in February 2025 about fraudulent messages designed to look like official school communications that spread false information about ICE activity. Schools have been combating misinformation alongside genuine safety concerns.

## Editorial Assessment

**UNVERIFIED** - The school message is authentic, but the underlying claim about ICE distributing food flyers has not been independently verified. No major Minnesota media has covered this story. No one has produced or photographed the alleged flyers.
