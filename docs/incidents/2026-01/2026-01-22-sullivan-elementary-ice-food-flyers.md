# School Warns ICE Distributing Fake Food Support Flyers (UNVERIFIED)

***We have been unable to verify this incident. If you know which Sullivan Elementary this is, or have any information about ICE using food support flyers to target families, please [contact us](mailto:mnicewitness@gmail.com).***

## Summary
A screenshot circulating on social media shows an announcement from "Sullivan Elementary" warning families that ICE is distributing flyers offering food support to families. The school advises families not to respond to these offers "for your safety" and directs those in need to contact the school's social workers instead. The location of this school and the date of the announcement are unknown.

## Sources
1. School App Screenshot (date unknown): Screenshot of Sullivan Elementary announcement (see below)

## What We Know
- A screenshot shows an announcement from "Sullivan Elementary" posted at 10:30 AM
- The announcement claims ICE is "sending out flyers offering food support to families"
- The school warns families not to respond to these offers "for your safety"
- The school offers to connect families with School Social Workers for legitimate support

## What We Don't Know
- Which Sullivan Elementary school issued this announcement (there are many across the US)
- The date the announcement was posted
- Whether the underlying claim about ICE flyers is accurate
- Whether this screenshot is authentic

## Context: ICE Ruse Tactics

The [Immigrant Defense Project](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/ice-ruses/) has documented ICE using various ruses since 2017, including:
- Pretending to be local police
- Claiming to investigate fake crimes
- Using plainclothes officers with vests marked "POLICE"

However, we found no documented cases of ICE specifically using food assistance flyers as a lure.

## Context: Fake ICE Messages

[Nash County Public Schools in North Carolina](https://www.wral.com/news/education/nash-county-schools-fake-ice-message-feb-2025/) warned in February 2025 about fraudulent messages designed to look like official school communications that spread false information about ICE activity. Schools have been combating misinformation alongside genuine safety concerns.

## Editorial Assessment
**UNVERIFIED** - This incident is based solely on a screenshot of a school announcement with no identifying information about location or date. We could not find:
- News coverage of this specific warning
- The specific Sullivan Elementary school that issued it
- Independent confirmation that ICE is distributing food support flyers

This could represent: (1) a legitimate school warning about a real ICE tactic, (2) a school passing along unverified community rumors, or (3) a fabricated screenshot. We are publishing this as unverified because the claim - if true - would represent a significant ICE tactic worth documenting.
