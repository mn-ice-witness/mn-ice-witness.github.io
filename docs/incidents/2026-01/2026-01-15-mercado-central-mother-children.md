# Mother Arrested Near Mercado Central; Two Children Left Behind

## Summary
A mother was arrested by ICE while cashing a check near Mercado Central on Lake Street. Her two sons, approximately middle-school and high-school age, were left behind at the market where she had dropped them off to get haircuts. Advocates struggled to locate the mother in federal detention because the children did not know her birth date.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Unknown
- **Citizenship:** Presumed undocumented
- **Children:** Two sons (one middle-school age, one young high-schooler)

## What Happened
The mother dropped her children off at Mercado Central with money to get haircuts while she walked a short distance to cash a check. She was arrested by ICE during that errand.

When Luis Argueta Jr., communications director for Unidos MN, stopped at Mercado Central over the weekend, a business owner asked for help and brought him upstairs, where he found the two boys shaking and crying.

## Difficulty Locating Mother
Even though Argueta works at an organization tracking ICE arrests, he was unable to locate the mother in the detention database. The children did not know her birth date, which is required to look someone up in the immigrant detention system.

## Resolution for Children
Advocates eventually helped the brothers find the phone number for an aunt, who came to pick them up along with other family members.

## Witness Account

### Luis Argueta Jr. (Unidos MN)
"It was really tough to hear them talking and asking them questions that I would never imagine asking my own kids to answer."

On the broader situation: "There are a number of people that are stuck at home, that fear for their lives because of what's happening right now."

## Context
Mercado Central is home to dozens of Latino-owned businesses. Community patrollers have been stationing themselves around the clock at the market, hoping to make workers and customers feel safe enough to do business during Operation Metro Surge.

## Editorial Assessment
**LOW** - Single source (Minnesota Reformer). No affected individual identification. Compelling account from named advocate (Luis Argueta Jr., Unidos MN) who directly interacted with the children. Needs corroboration or additional coverage to raise trustworthiness.
