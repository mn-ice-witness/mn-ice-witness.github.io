## Victim(s)
- **Description:** Local customer
- **Transportation:** Had biked to the store
- **Activity:** Paying for a drink at the time of arrest

## What Happened
According to staff member Zulma Sanchez, three ICE agents arrived at La Mexicana Market moments after a local customer had ridden his bike to the store. As the customer was paying for his drink, the agents prepared to detain him.

When Sanchez's mother (the owner) asked the agents to produce a warrant, they responded that they did not need a warrant in a public area. The agents took the man outside, placed him under arrest, and drove off.

## Witness Statement

### Zulma Sanchez (Staff member)
"It's just scary, you just freeze."

"People don't want to go out because they also fear the same. They fear they are doing their normal day-to-day things and they don't feel safe."

## Impact on Business
- Dining area normally busy at lunch was nearly empty the next day
- "It's not as [usually] as quiet as it is," Sanchez noted
- Widespread fear among non-citizen neighbors regardless of legal status

## Context
This arrest was part of "Operation Metro Surge" extending into Southern Minnesota. It demonstrates ICE enforcement reaching into small town businesses outside the Twin Cities metro, creating a chilling effect on immigrant communities.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Local newspaper reporting with named witness (staff member Zulma Sanchez). Clear documentation of the arrest and its immediate impact on the community. Demonstrates pattern of warrantless arrests in public spaces.
