# DHS Response: Pretti "Violently Resisted"

## Updates
- **Jan 24** - Video from multiple angles shows Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon, and that an agent removed his holstered gun before the shooting.

## Summary
Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, White House advisor Stephen Miller, and other administration officials have consistently claimed Pretti approached officers with a handgun and "violently resisted" attempts to disarm him. Video from multiple angles shows Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon, and that his gun was removed from its holster by an agent before he was shot. At a press conference, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino defended the shooting, claiming the officer fired "defensive shots" and that federal law enforcement had been "under attack" in Minneapolis. Bovino described the officer as "highly trained" with eight years of experience. Video shows multiple agents had Pretti on the ground when he was shot.

## Official Statements

### DHS Statement
> "At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault, an individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun."

DHS stated Pretti "violently resisted" officers' attempts to disarm him.

> "Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots."

DHS claimed Pretti possessed two additional magazines and no identification. The agency provided a photograph of the alleged firearm, identified by CNN as a SIG Sauer Emperor Scorpion.

### Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino
At an afternoon press conference, Bovino stated:
- DHS officers were conducting a "targeted operation" seeking a man with a criminal history including domestic assault, disorderly conduct, and driving without a valid license
- The officer who shot Pretti was "highly trained and had been serving as a Border Patrol agent for eight years" with "extensive training as a range safety officer and less lethal officer"
- Federal law enforcement has been "under attack" in Minneapolis
- Officers fired "defensive shots" at Pretti, who was armed
- The "situation is evolving and more information is forthcoming"
- Federal agents "need state and local law enforcement to help us coordinate to get violent criminals off the street"

Bovino declined to identify the officer involved and refused to answer a WCCO question about video evidence that contradicts the DHS narrative. He did not state whether Pretti pulled a gun or where the gun was when he was shot.

## Fact Check

### Claim: Pretti "approached" officers with a handgun
**Video Evidence:** Multiple videos from different angles show Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon. Analysis by Bellingcat and independent observers on social media show an agent removed Pretti's holstered gun before the shooting occurred. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry.

### Claim: Pretti "violently resisted" disarming
**Video Evidence:** Witness video shows multiple agents (Mayor Frey described "more than six masked agents") wrestling Pretti to the ground before shots were fired. Video shows Pretti was already on the ground and subdued when he was fatally shot.

### Claim: Agent fired "defensive shots"
**Video Evidence:** Footage from multiple angles shows Pretti pinned to the ground by several agents when shots were fired. Mayor Jacob Frey stated he saw "a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death." Governor Tim Walz called the shooting "sickening."

## Context
- This is the third shooting by federal agents in Minnesota in three weeks
- Pretti was a U.S. citizen, licensed nurse, and University of Minnesota graduate
- The FBI has blocked the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation
- Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and Attorney General Keith Ellison have announced a joint state investigation

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS statements well-documented. Video from multiple angles shows Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon, and that his gun was removed by an agent before the shooting. The circumstances remain under investigation by both federal and state authorities.
