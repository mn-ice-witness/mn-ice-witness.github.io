# Vance on Pretti: "Engineered Chaos" Unique to Minneapolis

## Summary

Following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, Vice President JD Vance posted on X claiming "this level of engineered chaos is unique to Minneapolis" and is "the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities." Vance provided no evidence to support his assertion that Minneapolis resistance was organized differently than other cities or that local authorities coordinated with protesters.

## Official Statement

### Vice President JD Vance (X post, Jan 25, 2026)

> "This level of engineered chaos is unique to Minneapolis. It is the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities."

Vance also stated that when he visited Minneapolis earlier in the week, "what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn't get out of hand." He accused local officials of ignoring requests from ICE to cooperate.

### Previous Statements (Jan 22, 2026)

During his Minneapolis visit on January 22, Vance stated:

> "local authorities have been told stand down, do not help ICE, promote the agitation but don't do anything to lower the temperature"

He framed this as preventing cooperation that exists "in nearly every jurisdiction, red or blue."

## Context

### What the Video Shows

Video evidence from the Pretti shooting shows the following sequence of events:

1. Pretti was holding a phone, not a weapon
2. Pretti appeared to be filming ICE agents — a First Amendment protected activity
3. Video shows Pretti attempting to assist a woman who had been pushed to the ground by agents
4. An agent appears to have removed Pretti's holstered firearm before the shooting
5. Multiple agents wrestled Pretti to the ground before shooting him

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara confirmed Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. Minnesota law permits open carry for licensed permit holders.

### Lack of Evidence for Claims

Vance characterized Minneapolis resistance as uniquely "engineered" but provided no specific evidence to support this assertion. According to ABC News, Vance offered "no specific evidence for his claims about organized resistance or deliberate obstruction." The NPR article noted that claims about fraud were described as having "largely spread by right-wing social media influencers online" rather than through official investigation.

### Local Response

Mayor Jacob Frey responded to Vance's characterization: "I'm done being told that our community members are responsible for the vitriol in our streets. I'm done being told that our local elected officials are solely responsible for turning down the temperature."

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Vice President's official X post, corroborated by multiple news sources covering his visit and statements.
