# Bovino on Pretti: "Let's Take a Look at the Gun"; Second Amendment Groups Raise Concerns

## Summary
At a press conference following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino deflected a reporter's question about whether Pretti ever reached for or brandished his weapon. When asked directly, Bovino pivoted: "This is under investigation. Those facts will come to light, but let's take a look at the gun." He then displayed a photo of Pretti's firearm and described it as "semi-automatic high capacity type, possibly a SIG Sauer." The deflection sparked concern from Second Amendment advocacy groups, who argue that merely possessing a legal firearm does not justify lethal force. Gun Owners of America, Second Amendment Foundation, and Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus have all called for a full investigation.

## The Press Conference Exchange

When a reporter asked Commander Bovino whether Pretti had ever reached for or brandished his weapon at federal agents, Bovino declined to answer directly:

> "This is under investigation. Those facts will come to light, but let's take a look at the gun. You can see the gun here on the screen there, that individual possessed. It appears to be a semi-automatic high capacity type, possibly a SIG Sauer or 9 millimeter."

Bovino ended the press conference after receiving just two questions about whether Pretti brandished the weapon. He never clarified when agents discovered the firearm or whether it was ever drawn during the encounter.

## Second Amendment Community Response

### Gun Owners of America (GOA)
> "We condemn the untoward comments of U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli. Federal agents are not 'highly likely' to be 'legally justified' in 'shooting' concealed carry licensees who approach while lawfully carrying a firearm. The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting—a right the federal government must not infringe upon."

### Second Amendment Foundation (SAF)
Director Kostas Moros stated: "We hope a full and thorough investigation will be conducted and justice properly served." SAF added: "People should not fear interacting with police officers just because they are lawfully carrying."

### Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus (MGOC)
Executive Director Bryan Strawser stated: "Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms—including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights."

The organization called for "a full and transparent investigation by both state and federal authorities."

### National Rifle Association (NRA)
The NRA called U.S. Attorney Essayli's comments "dangerous and wrong," stating: "Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens."

### Dana Loesch (Former NRA Spokesperson)
> "What he has or didn't have isn't the issue. What he was doing, with or without it, is the issue."

## Legal Experts React

**Rob Doar, Minnesota Gun Owners Law Center:**
> "If he had a permit to carry, it's not unlawful to be carrying while you're exercising your 1st Amendment right. You don't have to pick between which rights you exercise."

**Rick Hodsdon, Second Amendment Expert:**
Called the notion that federal agents would be justified in shooting anyone approaching them who is legally carrying a firearm "absurd."

## The Core Concern

Gun rights advocates argue that simply possessing a firearm—even with extra magazines—does not constitute a threat justifying lethal force. Video evidence shows an agent removed Pretti's holstered gun before he was shot, and no footage shows Pretti reaching for or brandishing the weapon. Minneapolis Police confirmed Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry.

The DHS position—that it is "unlawful" for protesters to carry firearms even with legal permits—has alarmed Second Amendment advocates who view this as an infringement on constitutional rights.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Press conference exchange documented by multiple news outlets including C-SPAN. Second Amendment groups' statements verified across multiple sources. The core factual dispute—whether Pretti ever reached for his weapon—remains unanswered by federal officials.
