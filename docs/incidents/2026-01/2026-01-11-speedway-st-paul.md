# Bystander Filming ICE Arrest Tackled and Detained at Speedway

## Summary
At a Speedway gas station, federal agents smashed a man's car window to arrest him after he refused to show citizenship documents. A bystander filming the arrest was told to back up, complied, but was then shoved, tackled, and detained by agents. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino was present at the scene.

## DHS Response

> "One U.S. citizen did not comply with the lawfully given order, and instead responded by hitting an officer and was arrested."
