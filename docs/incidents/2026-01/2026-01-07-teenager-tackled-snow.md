# Teenager Tackled in Snow by ICE Agent

## Summary
Video footage verified by the Associated Press shows an ICE agent chasing and tackling a teenager in the snow in Minneapolis on January 7, 2026. The teen, who had been in a car that hit a tree before the foot chase, can be heard yelling "Yo soy legal" ("I am legal" in Spanish) while being restrained face-down in the snow. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon shared the video, calling it "a cruel disgrace." The teenager's identity, legal status, and outcome remain unverified.

## Official Statements

### Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon
Simon shared the video on X, writing:

> "ICE agents in Minneapolis chase, tackle, and handcuff a child in the freezing cold and snow while he yells 'I'm legal! I'm legal!' How does this make us safer? How does this target 'the worst of the worst?' Horrifying and shameful."

He called the incident "a cruel disgrace."

*Note: The Mirror reports the teen said "Yo soy legal" (Spanish). Simon's post quoted it in English.*

## Context
This incident occurred on the same day as the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis, during the early days of Operation Metro Surge.
