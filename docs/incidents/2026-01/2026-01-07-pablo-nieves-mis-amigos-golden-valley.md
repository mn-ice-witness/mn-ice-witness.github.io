## Affected Individual(s)

- **Occupation:** Staff member at Mis Amigos Spanish Immersion, Golden Valley
- **Immigration status:** In the country legally with work authorization

## What Happened
- Pablo Nieves was detained while running errands (not at or near the daycare)

- Another Mis Amigos staffer's husband was also detained separately

## Daycare Response
Mis Amigos executive director Lori Semke told the Star Tribune:

> "He is just one of the most incredible people I've ever been able to work with. When somebody like Kristi Noem says, 'Believe us, we're picking up the worst of the worst,' that's not what they're doing."

Semke said she had no reason to believe Nieves was targeted for his work at a daycare center, but questioned why ICE detained someone who is in the country legally with work authorization.

## Community Response
- Parents at Mis Amigos organized to monitor ICE activity in shifts
- Parents escort staff to and from their vehicles
- GoFundMe established for detained staff member
- Daycare administrators have safety protocols and business attorneys in place

## Context
On January 7, masked men in ICE vehicles were reported circling the block near Mis Amigos. Parents were alerted through group chats, and some decided to take their children home early. Teachers were "very obviously trying to hold back tears" according to one parent.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Named individual (Pablo Nieves) with direct quotes from daycare executive director to Star Tribune. Daycare confirmed his legal status and work authorization. GoFundMe corroborates detention. Specific location of arrest and exact date not confirmed.
