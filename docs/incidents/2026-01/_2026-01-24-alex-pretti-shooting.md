# Alex Pretti Shot and Killed by Federal Agents

***Note: Responsibility for this incident has not been determined. DHS claims the man approached agents with a firearm and "violently resisted" disarming. However, critics and local officials note that video shows multiple agents had the man on the ground when he was fatally shot. Several unverified online analyses (including one by [Bellingcat](https://bsky.app/profile/bellingcat.com/post/3md6vleoxks2t), sourced below) claim that Pretti was disarmed before being shot. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have announced a joint state investigation and are asking residents to [submit evidence](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/ice-in-minnesota/mn-attorney-general-hennepin-county-attorney-ask-residents-to-submit-evidence-in-ice-shooting-investigation/89-9dda09e8-f299-4f3a-bc5f-a938dba30fb1). The FBI has cut the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension off from the federal investigation.***

## Summary
Federal agents fatally shot Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, licensed nurse, and lawful gun owner, in south Minneapolis. This is the third fatal shooting involving federal agents in Minnesota in three weeks, following the killing of Renee Good and the shooting of a Venezuelan man. Video shows multiple agents wrestling Pretti to the ground before shooting him multiple times.

### Local Officials

**Mayor Jacob Frey:**
> "I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death. How many more residents, how many more Americans, need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?"

The mayor is "demanding that ICE leave the city and state immediately."

**Governor Tim Walz:**
> "Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now."

**Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara:**
Confirmed Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. Stated police "have not been told official reports of what led to the shooting." Refused when ICE officials attempted to dismiss local police from the scene. Later told CNN that federal officials were blocking local police from accessing the scene.

**Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty:**
Called for the scene to be secured by local law enforcement. Announced joint investigation with Attorney General Keith Ellison and requested public submit evidence through online portal.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent news sources, video evidence from witness, official statements from both DHS and local officials. Footage shows multiple agents on top of Pretti when shots were fired. The circumstances remain disputed between federal and local authorities.
