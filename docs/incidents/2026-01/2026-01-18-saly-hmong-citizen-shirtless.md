# Hmong U.S. Citizen Detained Shirtless in Freezing Weather, Then Released

## Summary
A Hmong man named Saly, described as a naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, was reportedly detained by ICE agents who broke down his apartment door. According to family members, agents did not allow him to put on proper clothing before taking him outside in approximately 10-degree weather. After driving him around for nearly an hour, questioning, and fingerprinting him, agents released him after determining he had no criminal history. The family believes ICE was searching for someone who previously lived at the address.

## Witness Accounts
From Louansee Moua's Facebook post (Saly's sister-in-law):

"ICE came to my brother-in-law Saly's apartment, broke down the door, trashed the place, handcuffed him, and put a gun to his daughter-in-law's head. They did not allow him to put on proper clothing and forced him outside in freezing weather."

"Saly is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has NO criminal record."

"ICE drove him around for nearly an hour, questioned him, and fingerprinted him. Only after all of that did they realize he had no criminal history and no reason to be detained. They then dropped him back off at his apartment like nothing happened."

"We believe they were looking for someone who previously lived there, but instead of asking for identification, they chose violence, intimidation, and humiliation."

The post notes that Saly's mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse during the war in Laos who helped deliver premature twins. She ensured all her children became naturalized U.S. citizens.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin officially acknowledged this incident on January 19, 2026, confirming a U.S. citizen was detained and released at this address. While DHS disputes some details (claiming the citizen refused fingerprinting, family says he was fingerprinted), official corroboration confirms the core facts: ICE operation at this address, U.S. citizen detained, citizen released after verification. Video and photo evidence corroborate the encounter. Family account from Louansee Moua provides detailed witness testimony.
