# Hmong U.S. Citizen Detained Shirtless in Freezing Weather, Then Released

## Summary
A Hmong man named Saly, described as a naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, was reportedly detained by ICE agents who broke down his apartment door. According to family members, agents did not allow him to put on proper clothing before taking him outside in approximately 10-degree weather. After driving him around for nearly an hour, questioning, and fingerprinting him, agents released him after determining he had no criminal history. The family believes ICE was searching for someone who previously lived at the address.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
See: [DHS Response: Defends Detention of Hmong Citizen](#2026-01-19-dhs-response-saly-detention) - Statement from @TriciaOhio claims ICE was targeting two convicted sex offenders at the address who remain "at large."

### Family Rebuttal (January 19, 2026)
The family issued a formal press release on the same day categorically disputing all DHS claims. Key points from the family statement:
- Mr. Thao is a U.S. citizen with no criminal record
- He does not live with, nor has ever lived with, the individuals DHS claims
- Only people at the home are Mr. Thao, his son, daughter-in-law, and young grandson
- They do not know the individuals DHS references
- ICE did NOT present a warrant and did NOT ask for identification
- ICE agents forcibly entered the home with weapons drawn
- Mr. Thao went willingly despite knowing he had done nothing wrong
- He suffers from severe psoriasis, exacerbated by the cold exposure

The family has filed complaints with the ACLU of Minnesota and the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

### Local Officials

#### St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her (January 19-20, 2026)
Mayor Her, who has a personal connection to the Thao family, said she was "livid" about the incident. She visited the family after the raid.

**Personal Connection:** Mayor Her stated that Thao's mother was friends with her mother-in-law in Laos and that the families go back decades. "These are people who were looked at as my own uncles as I was growing up and it is unbelievable to me," she said.

**Criticism of ICE Conduct:**
- "This is an American citizen who has no criminal record, who was sleeping in his own house, that they broke a door down and put guns to his daughter-in-law's head."
- "They didn't ask for ID. They didn't ask to verify if it was the right person."
- Characterized the DHS statement as "irresponsible and reckless"
- Noted the family has lived in the home for two years and the person ICE was looking for does not live there anymore

**Community Concern:** Mayor Her raised concerns about the impact on the Hmong-American community, noting heightened fear of ICE exceeding historical anxieties from Laos.

## Witness Accounts
From Louansee Moua's Facebook post (Saly's sister-in-law):

"ICE came to my brother-in-law Saly's apartment, broke down the door, trashed the place, handcuffed him, and put a gun to his daughter-in-law's head. They did not allow him to put on proper clothing and forced him outside in freezing weather."

"Saly is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has NO criminal record."

"ICE drove him around for nearly an hour, questioned him, and fingerprinted him. Only after all of that did they realize he had no criminal history and no reason to be detained. They then dropped him back off at his apartment like nothing happened."

"We believe they were looking for someone who previously lived there, but instead of asking for identification, they chose violence, intimidation, and humiliation."

The post notes that Saly's mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse during the war in Laos who helped deliver premature twins. She ensured all her children became naturalized U.S. citizens.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin officially acknowledged this incident on January 19, 2026, confirming a U.S. citizen was detained and released at this address. While DHS disputes some details (claiming the citizen refused fingerprinting, family says he was fingerprinted), official corroboration confirms the core facts: ICE operation at this address, U.S. citizen detained, citizen released after verification. Video and photo evidence corroborate the encounter. Family account from Louansee Moua provides detailed witness testimony.
