# Hopkins Family of Four Detained; Returned After ICE Violates Court Order

## Updates
- **Jan 27** - [Family returned to Minnesota](https://www.hometownsource.com/sun_sailor/free/hopkins-family-detained-by-ice-returned-to-minnesota/article_4a7edf99-2df9-43cd-bc36-afdbf2c991ae.html) around 1 a.m. after ICE complied with court deadline.

## Summary
ICE detained Maria Velasco Hurtado while she was driving to work, then went to the family's Hopkins home and used her detention as leverage to get her husband Luis Fernando Chulca Chiluisa and their two children (ages 7 and 12) to come outside, where they were also detained. Despite a federal court order requiring the family to remain in Minnesota, ICE transported them to Texas. The family's attorney filed a motion for contempt, and the family was returned to Minnesota and released around 1 a.m. on January 27.

## What Happened
On the morning of January 22, 2026, ICE agents detained Maria Velasco Hurtado after surveilling her and waiting until she was isolated while driving to work. Agents then went to the family's home on Mainstreet in Hopkins and used her detention to convince her husband Luis Fernando Chulca Chiluisa and their two children to come outside, where they were also detained.

According to attorney Brian Clark of Lockridge Grindal Nauen PLLP: "What ICE did to the Velasco family yesterday morning is unconstitutional and immoral."

The family had active asylum applications and was in the United States legally. The attorney stated he was aware of no criminal record that would justify the detention, aside from Luis's 2024 misdemeanor DWI.

## Legal Action
Attorney Brian Clark filed an emergency habeas petition on the morning of January 22. A federal judge issued an order requiring the government to show cause by 2:00 PM that same day.

On January 23, the court ordered that the family must remain in Minnesota and be returned if they had already been relocated. ICE violated this order by transporting the family to Texas.

On January 24, attorneys filed a motion for contempt of court. The government was ordered to return the family by January 26.

The family was returned to Minnesota and released around 1 a.m. on January 27, 2026.

## Official Accounts

### Attorney Statement
Brian Clark stated: "They are together and recovering from this traumatizing experience at their Hopkins home." He alleged that ICE detained the mother while she was on her way to work and used her as leverage to lure the rest of the family out of their home.

### Hopkins Mayor
Mayor Patrick Hanlon called Luis Chulca Chiluisa a "model citizen" who worked in snow removal.

### Hopkins School District
The school superintendent termed the detention a "horrific experience." The district confirmed awareness of the family's return.

## Community Response
The Hopkins community established the #HopkinsStrong Relief Fund with a goal of $250,000 to support the family.

## Context
This detention occurred on the same day as the Tipan family detention, where a 2-year-old was flown to Texas despite a court order. Both cases involve ICE transporting families to Texas in violation of or shortly after federal court orders, raising questions about the agency's compliance with judicial oversight.

## Editorial Assessment

Named affected individuals. Hopkins Mayor and school superintendent provided statements. Clear documentation of court order violation and subsequent return.
