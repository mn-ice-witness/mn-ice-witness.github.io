## Official Statement

### Tricia McLaughlin, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs
> "In the face of violent attacks, ICE law enforcement arrested pedophiles, rapists, and drug traffickers in Minneapolis yesterday. Every single day our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from American communities. We will not let rioters slow us down from making Minnesota safe again—something Governor Walz and Mayor Frey REFUSED to do."

## Context

This press release was part of DHS's daily communications strategy during Operation Metro Surge to highlight arrests of individuals with criminal records.

### DHS Claims vs. Lawsuit Allegations

- **DHS claims** 70% of arrestees have prior criminal arrests or convictions
- **State lawsuit** alleges many arrestees "lack any criminal convictions whatsoever" and that agents are "stopping random people on the street to demand proof of citizenship"

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS press release. Criminal history claims not independently verified. This represents the federal justification narrative for Operation Metro Surge.
