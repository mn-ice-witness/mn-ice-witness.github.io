# Vice President Vance Defends 5-Year-Old's Detention: "What Are They Supposed to Do?"

## Summary

Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis on January 23, 2026, and addressed the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos. Vance defended ICE's actions, arguing the alternative would have been to "let a 5-year-old child freeze to death" and that exempting parents from arrest would grant universal immunity. Critics disputed his key claims, including the "freeze to death" scenario and his characterization of the family's legal status.

## Vice President Vance's Statements

### Initial Acknowledgment

Vance began by acknowledging the emotional weight of the story:

> "I see the story, and I'm a father of a 5-year-old, actually, 5-year-old little boy. And I think to myself: 'Oh, my God, this is terrible. How did we arrest a 5-year-old?'"

### Reframing the Narrative

Vance then shifted to the administration's framing:

> "What I find is that the 5-year-old was not arrested, that his dad was an illegal alien. And then they went, when they went to arrest his illegal alien father, the father ran."

### The "Freeze to Death" Argument

Vance posed what he characterized as a binary choice:

> "So the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old? Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?"

### The Universal Immunity Argument

Vance argued exemptions would create a loophole:

> "If the argument is that you can't arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement."

### On Local Cooperation

Vance blamed local authorities for operational difficulties:

> "It would make our lives a lot easier... if we had a little bit of cooperation from the state and local officials."

He also asked why police wouldn't assist:

> "Why not just have the mayor... tell the police officers, 'If an ICE officer is being assaulted... you should actually help him.'"

### Acknowledging Mistakes

Vance conceded the possibility of errors:

> "Even if 99.99% of the guys do everything perfectly, you're going to have people that make mistakes."

## Points of Factual Dispute

### Dispute 1: The "Freeze to Death" Claim

**What Vance said:** The alternative to detaining the child was letting him "freeze to death."

**What critics point out:** CNN's Sara Sidner directly refuted this claim: "The five year old child was never in danger of freezing to death. There were school officials there who said that they were happy to take him to the safe place, back to school. There was a mother just behind the door... But this idea that this child was just left outside, was going to be left outside to freeze to death, is just simply not true."

Columbia Heights school board chair Mary Granlund told reporters she personally offered to take Liam back to school until his mother could retrieve him.

### Dispute 2: The "Illegal Alien" Characterization

**What Vance said:** The father was an "illegal alien."

**What the family's attorney says:** Attorney Marc Prokosch stated the family entered the U.S. legally through the CBP One app in 2024, presented themselves at an official port of entry, and has an active asylum case with no deportation order. Prokosch said: "They used the app, they made an appointment, they came to the border and presented themselves to Customs and Border Patrol... They did everything right when they came in."

Columbia Heights Superintendent Zena Stenvik also stated she viewed the family's legal paperwork: "This family is following U.S. legal parameters and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation."

**The legal nuance:** The family used CBP One, a Biden-era legal entry program for asylum seekers. Immigration advocates note this complicates the "illegal alien" characterization, as the family entered through official channels and had pending claims. The Trump administration has taken the position that asylum-seekers lack legitimacy regardless of having followed legal entry processes.

### Dispute 3: Who "Abandoned" Whom

**What the administration says:** DHS claimed the father "fled on foot—abandoning his child" when agents approached.

**What school officials say:** Superintendent Stenvik provided a different timeline: ICE agents took the child from the vehicle and led him to the front door, instructing him to knock to see if anyone else was home. In this account, ICE had custody of the child before any flight occurred.

### Unaddressed Allegation: "Bait"

Neither Vance nor DHS has directly addressed school officials' claim that ICE used the 5-year-old as "bait"—instructing him to knock on the door to draw out other family members. Vance's remarks focused on the "freeze to death" framing rather than the sequence of events alleged by school officials.

## Analysis of Vance's Reasoning

### The Logic of His Argument

Vance presented what rhetoricians call a "false dilemma"—framing the situation as a binary choice between detaining the child and letting him freeze. This framing obscures the third option that was reportedly available: school officials on scene offered to take the child.

His "universal immunity" argument applies a general principle (you can't exempt all parents) to a specific case without addressing whether this particular operation was conducted appropriately or whether this particular family had legal status that should have affected the decision.

### Concerns Raised by Critics

1. **Factual accuracy:** The "freeze to death" claim appears to contradict multiple eyewitness accounts from school officials who were present and offered to care for the child.

2. **Legal status characterization:** Calling the father an "illegal alien" may be inaccurate if the family entered through CBP One with pending asylum claims. Even if one disagrees with asylum policies, describing someone with an active legal case as "illegal" is contested.

3. **Deflection from the core allegation:** By focusing on the "freeze to death" scenario, Vance avoided addressing the allegation that agents used a child to knock on a door—the behavior school officials called using a child as "bait."

4. **Acknowledgment of mistakes without accountability:** Vance's statement that "you're going to have people that make mistakes" acknowledges imperfection but doesn't address whether this case represents such a mistake or what consequences would follow.

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Vice President Vance made these statements publicly in Minneapolis before reporters. Multiple major outlets (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX 9, KARE 11) recorded and reported his remarks. The disputes with his characterization are documented through attorney statements, school official accounts, and reporter fact-checks.
