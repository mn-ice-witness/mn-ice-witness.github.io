# Border Patrol Commander Bovino CBS Interview

## Summary
U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino sat down with WCCO's Esme Murphy for an interview defending ICE operations in Minnesota. During the interview, Bovino claimed "90% to 95% of Minnesotans" support the immigration crackdown and stated U.S. citizens have "no reason to be scared." CBS News noted they could not find any polling to support the 90-95% claim. Bovino's assurance to citizens is contradicted by documented cases of U.S. citizens detained, injured, and hospitalized during Minnesota operations.

## Key Claims and Context

### Claim: "90% to 95% of Minnesotans" support the crackdown
> "When I travel to Target or Costco or the Whipple Building, people are thanking me... I'm just going to give an estimate—I think 90% to 95% of Minnesotans—and it's just based on the feedback that I get—support what we do."

**CBS News Response:** "CBS News Minnesota could not find any recent Minnesota-centered polling to verify Bovino's claim."

**Actual Polling (January 2026):**
- YouGov national poll: 52% of Americans disapprove of how ICE is handling its job
- 51% say ICE tactics are "too forceful" vs. 27% who say "about right"
- 56% of Americans say ICE agent's use of force in Good shooting was "inappropriate"
- ICE net approval fell 30 percentage points in one year

### Claim: Citizens have "no reason to be scared" (at 0:18)
> "Those individuals that are worried, if they're United States citizens or legal permanent residents, or have some type of legal status to be or remain here in the United States, there's no reason to be scared."

**Documented U.S. Citizens Detained in Minnesota:**

| Name | Date | What Happened |
|------|------|---------------|
| **Renee Good** | Jan 7, 2026 | Shot and killed by ICE agent while observing operations |
| **Shawn Jackson** | Jan 14, 2026 | Children (6 months to 11 years) tear-gassed; baby stopped breathing |
| **Aliya Rahman** | Jan 13, 2026 | Dragged from car, denied medical care, hospitalized for assault injuries |
| **Ryan Ecklund** | Jan 13, 2026 | Detained 9+ hours for filming agents; visible facial bruises |

### Claim: De-escalation efforts underway
> "Every day we de-escalate."

**CBS News Observation:** Reporter Nicole Sganga reported witnessing agents "confronting the protesters outside of the facility, telling demonstrators to move back and antagonizing them" — contradicting Bovino's claim.

### On Agent Who Shot Renee Good: "Hats off"
In a separate Fox News interview with Sean Hannity, Bovino praised the agent who shot Renee Good:

> "Hats off to that ICE agent. I'm glad he made it out alive. I'm glad he's with his family."

He described Good's Honda Pilot as "a 4,000-pound missile" and characterized the shooting as justified.

**Public Response:** The comment drew widespread criticism on social media. Author Don Winslow posted: "Listen very carefully to this. This is who they are and this is the world they want."

### On Duration of Operations
> "We'll be here til the mission is complete... as long as it takes."

Bovino indicated there is no defined end date for Operation Metro Surge.

## Notable Omissions

The interview did not address:
- Specific cases of U.S. citizens detained or injured
- The hospitalization of Aliya Rahman after being denied medical care
- The tear-gassing of six children, including a 6-month-old baby
- Reports from multiple news outlets documenting citizen detentions

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Interview documented by CBS Minnesota. Bovino's claims recorded on video. CBS News noted inability to verify polling claim. Citizen detention cases documented separately with sources. Polling data from YouGov/Economist and other outlets contradicts support claims.
