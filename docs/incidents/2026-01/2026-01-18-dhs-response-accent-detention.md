# DHS Statement: Defends Accent-Based Detention

## Summary
DHS posted on X defending the detention of a U.S. citizen whose accent was used as basis for suspicion. DHS claims the individual "at first lied about where he was born, claiming Minnesota" and later "changed his answer to Mexico." Records revealed he was a naturalized U.S. citizen and he was released. The statement explicitly confirms the agent "recognized one individual's accent as being from Mexico" as grounds for initial suspicion.

## Official Statement

Full statement from @DHSgov:

> Once again, the media is lying for clicks and deceptively pushing clips to demonize our brave law enforcement.
>
> U.S. Border Patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations in a public-access parking lot when several agitators exited their homes and began yelling at law enforcement in Spanish. One agent, who is fluent in Spanish, recognized one individual's accent as being from Mexico.
>
> During questioning, the individual at first lied about where he was born, claiming Minnesota. When asked for proof and a second time about where he was born, the individual refused and then changed his answer to Mexico. Lying to a federal agent is a crime. Given the inconsistencies in his story and refusal to provide documents, agents briefly detained him. Records check revealed he was a naturalized U.S. citizen, and he was immediately released. Our agents acted appropriate and with a high amount of professionalism—despite having several agitators yelling at them.

## Analysis

### DHS Claims vs. Documented Evidence
The DHS statement confirms several key facts:
1. A U.S. citizen was detained during an immigration enforcement operation
2. The agent's suspicion was based on the individual's "accent as being from Mexico"
3. The individual was briefly detained before a records check confirmed his citizenship

### Legal Implications
Immigration law professor Michael Kagan commented on Bluesky: "In which DHS says a U.S. citizen can be detained for speaking in Mexican accented Spanish. How many people in the US would be subject to being detained on this basis?"

The ACLU's class-action lawsuit filed January 15, 2026 specifically argues that arrests based on ethnic appearance or accent violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.

### Contradictions
DHS characterizes bystanders as "agitators" and claims the citizen "lied" by initially stating he was born in Minnesota. However:
- The original video shows the agent explicitly telling the man he doesn't believe he's a citizen "because of your accent"
- Being born in Minnesota or Mexico does not determine citizenship—naturalized citizens can be born abroad
- DHS confirms the citizen was released after records verified his status

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Primary source official statement from @DHSgov. The statement itself confirms accent was used as basis for suspicion. Commentary from immigration law expert provides legal context.
