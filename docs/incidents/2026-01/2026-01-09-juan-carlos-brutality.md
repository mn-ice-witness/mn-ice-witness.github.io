# Border Patrol Agent Knees Man in Face While Pinned Down

## Note on Verification
**What is verified:** Multiple videos from independent witnesses confirm a Border Patrol agent kneed a man in the face at least five times while other agents held him pinned to the ground. This is not in dispute.

**What requires more reporting:** The victim's identity and legal status. He appears to say "Juan Carlos" in the video. A GoFundMe claims he is a legal U.S. resident; DHS claims he is a "criminal alien from Ecuador." Neither claim has been independently verified. Whether the aftermath photos show the same person as in the video also requires confirmation, though the photos appear authentic. See [Snopes fact check](https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/16/juan-carlos-ice-images/) for full details on the verification efforts.

## Summary
A Border Patrol agent kneed a man in the face at least five times while other agents pinned him face-down on the pavement near 22nd & Chicago in south Minneapolis. The victim was hospitalized with difficulty breathing. On video, the man appears to say his name is "Juan Carlos."

## Witness Accounts

### Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora
Heard a horn blaring and looked out a second-floor window onto Chicago Avenue near 24th Street. Witnessed the Border Patrol Suburban going the wrong way and hitting the victim's car head-on, followed by agents smashing the window and pulling him out.

### Monica Bicking
A nurse at a nearby homeless shelter who heard residents and staff yelling that ICE was outside. She ran out and started recording.

> "It was completely unnecessary and uncalled for."

### Bystander Videos
Multiple bystanders filmed the incident. On video, when asked his name, the victim replied with what sounds like "Juan Carlos" as an agent told him to get in the car. One witness noted that one officer repeatedly kneed the man in the face and seemed to stop only when he realized he was being filmed.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
DHS told CNN the victim is a "criminal alien from Ecuador." See full statement and fact check: [DHS Response: Kneeing Victim is "Criminal Alien from Ecuador"](/entry/2026-01-18-dhs-response-juan-carlos)

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** (for the incident itself) - Multiple video recordings from independent witnesses, eyewitness accounts from named witnesses (Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora, Monica Bicking), and coverage by Minnesota Reformer, CNN, and other outlets. The video evidence showing an agent kneeing the victim in the face while he was pinned down is unambiguous.

**The victim's name and legal status require more reporting.** The man appears to say "Juan Carlos" on video. Documentary evidence (car purchase contract, violation ticket) supports this name, but his immigration status remains disputed between activist accounts and DHS claims.
