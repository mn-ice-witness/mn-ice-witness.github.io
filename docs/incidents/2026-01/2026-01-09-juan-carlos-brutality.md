## Witness Accounts

### Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora
Heard a horn blaring and looked out a second-floor window onto Chicago Avenue near 24th Street. Witnessed the Border Patrol Suburban going the wrong way and hitting Juan Carlos's car head-on, followed by agents smashing the window and pulling him out.

### Monica Bicking
A nurse at a nearby homeless shelter who heard residents and staff yelling that ICE was outside. She ran out and started recording.

> "It was completely unnecessary and uncalled for."

### Bystander Videos
Multiple bystanders filmed the incident. On video, when asked his name, the injured man replied "Juan Carlos" as an agent told him to get in the car. One witness noted that one officer repeatedly kneed the man in the face and seemed to stop only when he realized he was being filmed.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
The Department of Homeland Security did not return emails seeking information about the incident.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple video recordings from bystanders, eyewitness accounts from named witnesses (Yarrow Tkachuk-Kedziora, Monica Bicking), coverage by Minnesota Reformer, and a GoFundMe corroborating the hospitalization and injuries. The video evidence showing the agent kneeing Juan Carlos in the face while he was pinned down is particularly damning.
