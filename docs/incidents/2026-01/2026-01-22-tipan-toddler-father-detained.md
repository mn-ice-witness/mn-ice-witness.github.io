## Updates
- **Jan 23** - [ICE flew the 2-year-old and her father to Texas](https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/ice-flew-2-year-old-to-texas-despite-court-order-to-release-her-from-custody/), separating the child from her mother, 19 minutes after a federal judge ordered the toddler released. A government attorney pledged to return the girl to Minnesota on Friday.

## Summary
ICE detained Elvis Joel Tipan Echeverria and his 2-year-old daughter Chloe Renata Tipan Villacis near Powderhorn Park in South Minneapolis as they returned from a grocery store. Attorneys for the family say they were asylum-seekers pulled over without a warrant and did not have a final order for removal. A federal judge ordered the toddler released by 9:30 PM, but ICE placed both on a commercial flight to Texas 19 minutes after the order was signed. A government attorney subsequently pledged to return the girl to Minnesota.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Elvis Joel Tipan Echeverria (father)
- **Citizenship:** Asylum-seeker (from Ecuador)
- **Status:** Detained

- **Name:** Chloe Renata Tipan Villacis (daughter)
- **Age:** 2 years old
- **Citizenship:** Asylum-seeker (from Ecuador)
- **Status:** Flown to Texas despite court order; government pledged return

## What Happened
At approximately 1:09 PM on January 22, 2026, Border Patrol agents stopped Elvis and his 2-year-old daughter Chloe near Powderhorn Park in South Minneapolis as they returned from a grocery store. Both were detained.

According to family attorneys, the two were asylum-seekers who were pulled over without a warrant and did not have a final order for removal.

Video circulating on social media appeared to show agents using chemical irritants and flash-bang devices as crowds gathered at the scene. DHS stated approximately 120 people surrounded federal agents during the detention.

The mother, Deicy Villacis Ruiz, was left without her husband and daughter. The family attorneys said agents broke car windows and prevented the father from bringing his daughter inside.

## Legal Action Timeline
- **5:37 PM** - Attorney Kira Kelley filed emergency petitions for release
- **6:17 PM** - Kelley filed a motion to halt transfer outside Minnesota
- **8:10 PM** - U.S. District Judge Kathy Menendez signed an order for the toddler's release
- **8:30 PM** - ICE placed father and daughter on a commercial flight to Texas, 19 minutes after the court order

Attorneys characterized the removal as "bad-faith conduct" and filed additional motions seeking to block all interstate ICE transfers from Minnesota. Attorney Irina Vaynerman, CEO of Groundwork Legal, said: "To me, that is clearly part of this effort to try to evade the court's jurisdiction. We have never seen this level of depravity with a 2-year-old."

A government attorney subsequently pledged ICE would honor the ruling and return the girl to Minnesota on Friday.

## Official Accounts

### Department of Homeland Security
DHS stated that at approximately 1:09 PM CT on January 22, "while conducting a targeted enforcement operation, Border Patrol identified Elvis Tipan-Echeverria, an illegal immigrant from Ecuador who committed felony reentry."

DHS claimed:
- Tipan Echeverria "was driving erratically with a child in the vehicle"
- He "refused multiple lawful commands to open his door or lower his window"
- Agents "attempted to give the child to the mother who was in the area, but she refused"
- "Approximately 120 individuals surrounded the agents blocking them in and preventing exit"
- "Agitators in the crowd then began to throw rocks and garbage cans toward the agents and child"

DHS also stated that "the child and father are now reunited at a federal facility."

### Minneapolis City Council
Council member Jason Chavez reported the detention and organized a GoFundMe campaign to support the family with legal fees, bond requests, rent, and other necessities. The campaign raised over $58,000 from more than 1,600 donors.
