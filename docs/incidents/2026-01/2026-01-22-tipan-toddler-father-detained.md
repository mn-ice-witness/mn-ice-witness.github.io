## What Happened
On January 22, 2026, Elvis and his 2-year-old daughter Chloe were driving home from the grocery store in South Minneapolis when ICE agents detained them during a traffic stop. Both were taken into custody.

The family is from Ecuador. The mother, Deicy Villacis Ruiz, was left without her husband and daughter.

## Legal Action
Attorneys filed emergency habeas corpus petitions seeking the release of both the toddler and her father. Court filings stated: "Respondents have taken a 2-year-old into custody – an escalation of violence that is unspeakable, cruel and without any legal basis or justification."

The filings cited:
- Active asylum claims
- Warrantless arrest

A federal judge ordered the child released by 9:30 PM Friday, January 23. The attorney was granted parental authority to pick up the child from detention and return her to her mother.

## Official Accounts

### Minneapolis City Council
Council member Jason Chavez reported the detention and organized a GoFundMe campaign to support the family with legal fees, bond requests, rent, and other necessities. The campaign raised over $58,000 from more than 1,600 donors.

## Context
This detention occurred during ICE's Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities. It came one day after the high-profile detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father at school pickup in Columbia Heights, making it the second case of a young child detained within 48 hours.

## Editorial Assessment

Legal filings documented in court. Named affected individuals with family details confirmed via GoFundMe organized by the reporting official. Judge issued release order.
