## What Happened

At approximately 11:00 a.m. on January 27, ICE agents approached the Ecuadorian Consulate at 2310 Central Avenue NE in Minneapolis. A consulate employee ran to the door to prevent them from entering. According to the Ecuadorian government, an ICE officer threatened to "grab" the staffer.

The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations prohibits foreign law enforcement from entering a consulate without the consent of the head of the consular post. Ecuador's Foreign Ministry issued a formal protest to the U.S. Embassy in Quito, calling the attempted entry a violation of international law.

Minneapolis City Council President Elliott Payne confirmed ICE agents attempted to enter the consulate but were refused entry.

## Context

The incident occurred on the same day that Federal Judge Patrick Schiltz ordered ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons to appear in court for contempt over violations of court orders. The Tobay Robles case—involving an Ecuadorean man held for three weeks despite court orders—was central to that contempt proceeding.

## Official Accounts

### Ecuador Foreign Ministry
Ecuador filed a formal diplomatic protest with the U.S. Embassy, stating the attempted entry violated international law governing consular relations.

### DHS Response
DHS has not publicly commented on the attempted consulate entry.

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Multiple major outlets (Axios, Washington Post, KARE 11, MPR News) confirmed the incident. Ecuador's Foreign Ministry filed a formal diplomatic protest, providing official government confirmation. The Vienna Convention violation is a matter of international law.
