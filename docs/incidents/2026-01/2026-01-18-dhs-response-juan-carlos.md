# DHS Response: Kneeing Victim is "Criminal Alien from Ecuador"

## Summary
When asked about video showing a Border Patrol agent kneeing a man in the face at least five times while other agents pinned him to the ground, DHS told CNN the victim is a "criminal alien from Ecuador." A GoFundMe claims he is a legal U.S. resident. Neither claim has been independently verified.

## Official Statement

DHS statement to CNN:

> The man is a "criminal alien from Ecuador."

No additional details about specific criminal history or immigration status were provided.

## Snopes Investigation

[Snopes conducted a detailed fact check](https://www.snopes.com/news/2026/01/16/juan-carlos-ice-images/) of the images and video. Key findings:

### Social Media Skepticism
Some social media users expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of the images showing the victim's injuries. The images spread on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, with some posts claiming the man was a U.S. citizen (the GoFundMe actually claims "resident," not citizen).

### Video Verification
- **Witness statement:** Monica Bicking, an ER nurse who filmed the incident, shared the full four-minute unedited video with Snopes and stated: *"The video was not edited. I saw ICE brutalize a completely helpless man with my own eyes. I thought they were going to kill him right in-front of me."*
- **Metadata:** Video metadata confirmed it was taken around noon on Jan. 9 on Minneapolis' Chicago Avenue — matching the GoFundMe's account.
- **No signs of editing:** The video showed no signs of being doctored.

### Photo Verification
- **Reverse-image search:** Found no evidence of the injury photos being published online prior to Cordová-Clough's posts.
- **AI detection:** Sight Engine and Hive Moderation both determined the photos were not likely AI-generated.
- **No editing detected:** The images showed no signs of manipulation.

### Snopes Conclusion
Snopes did not formally rate the claim because, while the evidence strongly suggests the photos legitimately show the same man in the video, there is no definitive proof until the victim comes forward. The kneeing incident itself is not in dispute.

## Conflicting Evidence

### GoFundMe and Activist Accounts
According to the GoFundMe set up by Ismael Cordová-Clough (who tracks immigration enforcement activity):
- The victim, identified as "Juan Carlos," is a "U.S. resident"
- He was "observing ICE activity" when targeted
- He is currently unhoused and living in his car

### Documentation
The Minnesota Reformer reported:
- A car purchase contract with the first and middle names "Juan Carlos" was obtained from the scene
- The journalist verified the contract using a Minnesota DMV search of the driver's license number
- The last name on the car contract matched the name on a ticket issued to the victim

### Ticket Issued
The victim was issued a U.S. District Court Violation Notice for "Failure to carry Alien Registration" — a civil ticket, not an arrest for criminal activity.

## Fact Check

**DHS Claim:** The victim is a "criminal alien from Ecuador"

**Conflicting Information:**
- GoFundMe states he is a U.S. resident
- He was issued a civil violation ticket, not arrested for criminal activity
- DHS provided no specific criminal history claims
- Video shows the victim was not resisting when agents kneed him repeatedly

**What Remains Unverified:**
- The victim's exact immigration status
- DHS has not provided documentation supporting the "criminal alien" claim
- The victim has not publicly come forward to confirm his status

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS statement directly sourced from CNN reporting. The DHS claim is documented exactly as stated. Neither DHS's claim nor the GoFundMe's claim about the victim's legal status has been independently verified.
