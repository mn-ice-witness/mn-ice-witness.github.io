# Libyan Man Seeking Medical Treatment Detained, Shackled Despite Skin Condition

## Summary
Hani Duglof, 32, who came to Minnesota from Libya in 2014 for life-saving medical treatment for a rare skin condition, was detained by ICE and shackled - despite having a condition that makes his skin as fragile as paper. He has been in the U.S. legally awaiting asylum decision for nearly a decade.

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Hani Duglof
- **Age:** 32
- **Origin:** Libya
- **Citizenship:** Legal status, awaiting asylum (application delayed by federal government for nearly a decade)
- **Medical Condition:** Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) - makes skin and throat as fragile as paper
- **Education:** Associate's degree (St. Paul College), Bachelor's in computer networking (Metro State University)
- **Occupation:** IT worker for Twin Cities health care system
- **Notable:** His face appears on marketing banners at St. Paul College encouraging students to "Fit In. Stand out."

## Background
Duglof and his brother came from Libya in 2014 under visas to be screened for a bone marrow transplant pioneered by the University of Minnesota. The U of M and Mayo Clinic draw people from around the world for treatment of rare conditions.

## Detention Conditions
- Legs bound in metal cuffs despite his condition
- Told his brother conditions are "crowded" and "rough"
- "They were sitting on the floor"
- Friction from shackles exacerbates wounds on his legs
- Has since been moved in shackles to a hospital

## Legal Status
Duglof is in the U.S. legally, but his ultimate status has been uncertain for nearly a decade because **federal officials have delayed action on his asylum request**, according to his attorney.

## Current Situation
Family is trying to:
1. Prevent transfer to detention facility in El Paso, Texas
2. Obtain bond so he can be released to Woodbury to manage his condition

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Detailed reporting from Star Tribune with family interviews, medical background, education records. The legal status claim is supported by attorney statements. Demonstrates detention of someone in legal status whose asylum case was delayed by the government itself.
