## Official Statements

### Secretary Kristi Noem
> "She then proceeded to weaponize her vehicle and she attempted to run over a law enforcement officer. This appears as an attempt to kill or to cause bodily harm to the agent — an act of domestic terrorism."

> "ICE agents repeatedly ordered her to get out of the car and to stop obstructing law enforcement, but she refused to obey their commands."

> The officer fired "defensive shots" and "used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues."

### DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin
> "This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along — that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponized her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement."

DHS claimed Good "followed federal ICE agents to two other locations prior to the shooting and was blocking the roadway to interfere with ongoing enforcement."

## Fact Check

### Claim: Good "weaponized her vehicle" to run over officers

**Video Evidence:** Multiple independent analyses have questioned this claim:
- Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey: Video "did not appear to suggest" vehicle was being used as weapon
- Thomas Warrick (former DHS deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism): "Deadly force was not required to resolve the incident"
- Bellingcat analyzed 5 videos and found Good was turning away from Ross when shot

### Claim: Good refused orders to exit vehicle

**Video Evidence:** Agent Ross approached vehicle, pulled door handle, then Good began to drive. She was shot within seconds.

### Claim: "Domestic terrorism"

**Local Response:** Mayor Frey called the federal narrative "garbage"

## Subsequent Developments

- **January 13:** Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned, citing DOJ's "reluctance to investigate the shooter"
- **January 13:** Deputy AG Todd Blanche said there was "no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation"

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS statements well-documented. Claims disputed by local officials, independent security experts, and video analysis from multiple news organizations.
