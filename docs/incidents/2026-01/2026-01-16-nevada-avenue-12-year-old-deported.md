# Venezuelan Family Detained, Including 12-Year-Old Sent to Texas

## Summary
Federal agents used a battering ram to enter a home on Nevada Avenue East in St. Paul, detaining six residents including a 12-year-old boy. The family immigrated from Venezuela in 2023, and the detained adults possessed work permits and state-issued IDs. The 12-year-old was flown to an immigration detention facility in San Antonio, Texas. Agents claimed to have a search warrant but never displayed one; a warrant that appeared on the doorstep the next day had no case number or file stamp and no record of being filed with the court.
