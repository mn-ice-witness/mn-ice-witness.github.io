# Venezuelan Family Detained, Including 12-Year-Old Sent to Texas

## Updates
- **Jan 20** - Federal judge orders all six family members released after DHS failed to produce warrant by deadline; must be returned to Minnesota within 72 hours

## Summary
Federal agents used a battering ram to enter a home on Nevada Avenue East in St. Paul, detaining six residents including a 12-year-old boy. The family immigrated from Venezuela in 2023, and the detained adults possessed work permits and state-issued IDs. The 12-year-old was flown to an immigration detention facility in San Antonio, Texas. Agents claimed to have a search warrant but never displayed one; a warrant that appeared on the doorstep the next day had no case number or file stamp and no record of being filed with the court.

## The Warrant Issue
- Agents claimed to have a search warrant during the raid but never displayed it
- A warrant appeared on the doorstep the following day
- The warrant was issued by a state court (Ramsey County), not a federal court
- It lacked a case number and file stamp
- There was no record of it being filed with the court
- The document did not match a sample warrant provided by a state court spokesperson
- Agents told neighbors it was part of a narcotics investigation

## Suspicious Circumstances
Neighbors noted that a package delivery occurred minutes before the raid, raising questions about how agents knew someone would be home to receive it.

## Official Accounts

### Federal Response
DHS failed to respond to court deadline to produce warrant. U.S. District Judge John Tunheim granted habeas corpus petition and ordered all six family members released within 72 hours. They must be "immediately returned" to Minnesota prior to release.

### Witness Accounts
Neighbors who spoke with someone inside the home during the raid provided details about the warrant discrepancies and the family's legal status.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence exists (surveillance footage). Fox 9 investigative report with detailed documentation of warrant irregularities. Court records examined. Family's legal status (work permits, state IDs) documented. 12-year-old's transfer to Texas confirmed by family friend.
