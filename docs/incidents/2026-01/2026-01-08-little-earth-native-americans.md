# Four Homeless Oglala Sioux Citizens Detained Near Little Earth

## Summary
Four homeless men, all enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and U.S. citizens, were detained by ICE while sheltering under a bridge near the Little Earth Housing Project in the East Phillips neighborhood. They were taken into custody without their names being recorded by authorities. At least one was held for 12 hours before release. The tribe sent attorneys and leadership to Minneapolis to locate the men.

## Victim(s)
- **Number:** Four
- **Names:** Not disclosed (taken into custody without names being recorded)
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizens, enrolled Oglala Sioux Tribe members
- **Status:** Homeless, living under a bridge near Little Earth

## What Happened
Four unhoused Oglala Sioux Tribe members were detained by ICE agents near the Little Earth Housing Project in Minneapolis. The men were unable to provide documentation at the time of detention. Federal agents took them into custody without recording their names, making it difficult for tribal officials to locate them afterward.

At least one of the men was released after being held for approximately 12 hours. His whereabouts after release were unknown to the community.

## Tribal Response
Oglala Sioux Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out:
- Was "made aware" of the detentions and instructed tribal attorneys to contact Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan
- Traveled to Minneapolis with tribal leadership to locate the detained members
- Prepared enrollment documents for federal officials to verify citizenship

Chase Iron Eyes, Oglala Sioux Tribe member:
- "We're in this together...the dividing line between law and order, and lawlessness, is being blurred at all times. We're going to find our people."

Tribal guidance issued to members:
- "I am a citizen of the OGLALA LAKOTA NATION, a federally recognized Tribal Nation...ICE has no lawful authority to detain me."
- Members instructed to "not speak without an attorney present" if detained

## Local Officials
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan (citizen of White Earth Nation):
- "The obvious racial profiling happening to our community is disgraceful."
- Worked with tribal attorneys to help locate detained individuals

## Witness Accounts
Little Crow Belcourt (community member):
- "They're just pulling people over at random, if you're Brown."

Jearica Fountain (community advocate):
- "Native Americans are being detained, but then no one knows where to find them."

## Significance
- Native Americans are U.S. citizens by birth and cannot be deported
- Detaining tribal members without recording names made it impossible for the tribe to locate them
- Multiple Minnesota tribes (Red Lake Nation, Fond Du Lac Band, Mille Lacs Band, Leech Lake Band) issued statements condemning the detentions
- Mille Lacs Band expanded tribal ID distribution to ages 5+ in response

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Four independent sources (ICT, CBS Minnesota, Fox 9, Newsweek). Tribal president confirmed detentions. Tribal attorneys and leadership traveled to Minneapolis to locate members. Pattern consistent with other documented Native American detentions during this period.
