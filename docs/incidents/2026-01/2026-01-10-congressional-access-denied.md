# Congressional Representatives Denied Access to Whipple ICE Facility

## Summary
Three Minnesota Democratic representatives—Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig, and Kelly Morrison—were ordered to leave the Whipple Federal Building ICE facility approximately 10 minutes after being granted entry. Officials cited funding from the "One Big Beautiful Bill" and claimed lawmakers failed to provide mandatory seven-day advance notice. The representatives had briefly observed approximately 20 detainees, describing young men sitting with their heads in their hands.

## Timeline
- **Saturday morning, Jan 10:** Three representatives arrive at Whipple Federal Building
- Representatives initially granted access by former acting director
- Briefly permitted to view part of the monitoring room
- Observed approximately 20 detainees
- **Approximately 10 minutes after entry:** Ordered to leave the facility
- Representatives hold press conference outside building

## What They Observed
Rep. Morrison: "We saw a lot of young men sitting with their heads in their hands. We were not allowed to speak to any of them."

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Justification
DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated lawmakers must provide seven-day advance notice for congressional visits. She cited "safety of detainees and staff" and compliance with existing court orders and policies.

Officials also cited that the facility's funding came through the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" rather than congressional appropriations.

### Congressional Response
Rep. Omar: "Ten minutes after we entered, we were told to back out... the explanation we got was, 'Yes, the law's on your side, but we don't care.'"

Rep. Omar posted on X: "I was just denied access to the ICE processing center at the Whipple Building. Members of Congress have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained. The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities."

Rep. Craig: "We are going to continue to show up. We are going to continue to do our job." She also stated she brought the court case showing congressional access is legally allowed, but officials "refused to look at it."

Rep. Morrison: "Conducting oversight of American taxpayer-funded facilities is not only our legal right, but our constitutional duty."

## Context
The incident occurred three days after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good at the Whipple building on January 7, 2026. The facility has been the primary processing center for detainees during Operation Metro Surge.
