## Key Quotes

### On Roosevelt High School
"As a graduate of Roosevelt High School and as the former governor of Minnesota, I'm so proud of Roosevelt High School and how they stood up for what is supposed to be America and freedom. And freedom is not arresting people without warrants."

"I am proud of what they did in keeping ICE off this campus. We don't need federal troops coming in here without warrants. Good for these people that stood up. They are teaching students that we have to be a country of law and a country of the Constitution."

### On ICE Tactics
"Minnesota, we'll take care of ourselves. We don't need federal troops coming in here without warrants."

Ventura called ICE "the draft-dodging coward's Gestapo" and said the U.S. is becoming a "third-world country" where the military does police work in cities.

### On the Renee Good Shooting
Ventura called the killing of Renee Good a "tragedy" and warned: "This is what happens in a dictatorship. Wake up. Read your history of Germany and start comparing tactics of what happened in 1930s Germany to what is happening here."

### On Running for Governor
"Maybe it's time for Jesse. I only did one term. I'm owed a second."

## Context
Ventura's visit came less than 24 hours after the January 7 incident at Roosevelt High School where Border Patrol agents descended on the school, deployed chemical irritants, and detained a special education assistant who is a U.S. citizen. The incident occurred the same day as the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent approximately 3 miles away.
