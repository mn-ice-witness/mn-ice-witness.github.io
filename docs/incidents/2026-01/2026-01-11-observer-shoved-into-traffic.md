## Official Accounts

ICE has not publicly commented on this specific incident.

### Commentary
X user Brian Krassenstein posted the video and wrote: "ICE agent in Minneapolis just violently SHOVED a man filming their vehicle to the ground. This is illegal, as it is excessive force. Courts routinely rule that throwing or violently pushing a non-threatening person to the ground for a minor obstruction is unconstitutional."

## Context

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence from the incident, CNN original reporting, multiple syndicated sources across CNN affiliates, clear footage of the shoving.
