# Man Seeks Refuge in Bloomington Office During 2-Hour ICE Standoff

## Summary
A man being pursued by ICE agents fled on foot and took refuge inside the Wilderness Inquiry office building in Bloomington. Staff allowed him to remain in the vestibule and denied ICE entry, citing lack of a judicial warrant. After a two-hour standoff with negotiations through an interpreter, the man voluntarily surrendered after ICE presented a felony arrest warrant.

## What Happened
The man was stopped by ICE agents while driving to work near the Walmart in Bloomington. He fled on foot and ran into the Wilderness Inquiry building, where staff allowed him to stay in the vestibule. The building's staff consulted legal counsel about what to do while the man remained visible to ICE agents through the glass.

Bloomington Police arrived but their involvement was "limited to helping maintain the peace." ICE agents were denied entry as they initially lacked a judicial warrant for the private building.

## Statements

### Michelle Zarazua (Girlfriend)
"He called me and he told me that he was in this building because he was scared."

### Erika Rivers, Wilderness Inquiry Executive Director
"I am proud of the Wilderness Inquiry team, who showed composure and compassion during a frightening and unprecedented situation. Our staff did everything in their power to help someone in distress and to ensure that law enforcement followed established protocols."

### Bloomington Police
Confirmed their involvement was "limited to helping maintain the peace."

## Context
This incident occurred during Operation Metro Surge, an expanded ICE enforcement operation in Minnesota. On the same day (Monday, January 6), ICE reported arresting more than 150 people in "Minneapolis" (used as catch-all term for Twin Cities metro).

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Detailed reporting from Sahan Journal with named sources (girlfriend, company executive director). Video evidence exists. Timeline is clear. Demonstrates both the fear driving people to flee and the legal distinction between administrative vs. judicial warrants.
