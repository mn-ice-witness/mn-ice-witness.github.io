## Broader Context

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Video evidence exists from the business owner's own recording. The incident was covered by Bring Me The News with direct quotes from the owner's social media post. However, there is only one news source and no official response or independent witness corroboration beyond the owner's account. The owner's Facebook video serves as primary evidence.
