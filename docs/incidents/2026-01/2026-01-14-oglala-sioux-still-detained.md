# Three Oglala Sioux U.S. Citizens Still Detained at Fort Snelling

## Summary
Four days after ICE detained four Oglala Sioux tribal members from a Minneapolis homeless encampment, three remain in custody at Fort Snelling. Tribal President Frank Star Comes Out issued a formal memorandum to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum demanding immediate release, calling the detention "a treaty violation" and stating "tribal citizens are not aliens" and are "categorically outside immigration jurisdiction." DHS refused to provide information unless tribe enters immigration agreement with ICE.

## Timeline
- **Jan 10 (Fri)** - Four Oglala Lakota men detained from homeless encampment under bridge near Little Earth
- **Jan 13** - Axios, MPR report on tribe's demands; tribe locates detainees
- **Jan 14 (Tue)** - President Frank Star Comes Out issues formal memorandum to DHS Sec. Noem and Interior Sec. Burgum demanding release
- **Jan 16-17 (upcoming)** - Oglala Sioux Tribe enrollment office organizing assistance at Minneapolis American Indian Center to help tribal members obtain documentation and IDs

## Official Accounts

### Tribal Statement
President Frank Star Comes Out issued formal memorandum stating:
- "Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty."
- "Tribal citizens are not aliens and are categorically outside immigration jurisdiction."
- "This is a treaty violation. Treaties are not optional. Sovereignty is not conditional. Our citizens are not negotiable."
- "We will not enter an agreement that would authorize, or make it easier for, ICE or Homeland Security to come onto our tribal homeland to arrest or detain our tribal members."

### Tribal Demands
1. Immediate release of all enrolled tribal citizens held by immigration
2. Full, comprehensive information from DHS on detainees
3. Written assurances that ICE will stop detaining Native Americans
4. Immediate government-to-government consultation

### DHS Response
When tribe contacted DHS requesting information about detained tribal members:
- DHS released only first names of detainees
- DHS refused additional information unless tribe "entered into an immigration agreement with ICE"
- Tribe declined this condition
- DHS did not respond to media requests for comment

## Legal Context
- ICE agents can arrest U.S. citizens in some cases, but agents cannot place U.S. citizens in immigration detention after citizenship is verified
- Citizens of tribal nations became U.S. citizens in 1924 through the Indian Citizenship Act
- Oglala Sioux Tribe promises aggressive legal action to secure release

## Historical Context
Scholar Nick Estes, associate professor of American Indian Studies at University of Minnesota, noted Fort Snelling's "notorious anti-Indigenous, specifically anti-Dakota, history." Fort Snelling was the first military outpost in the area and Dakota people were held prisoner there during the Dakota War of 1862.

Star Comes Out stated: "The irony is not lost on us. Lakota citizens who are reported to be held at Fort Snelling — a site forever tied to the Dakota 38+2 — underscores why treaty obligations and federal accountability matter today, not just in history."

The site was historically used as a concentration camp for Native people during the Dakota removal period.

## Related Incidents
Indigenous Americans increasingly face ICE targeting. Actress Elaine Miles (Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation) reported ICE agents called her tribal ID "fake" during November 2025 detention.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Major national story with coverage from AP, CNN, Washington Post, Axios, MPR, CBS, Newsweek, and multiple other outlets. Direct quotes from tribal president's formal memorandum to federal officials. Documents ongoing illegal detention of U.S. citizens and DHS stonewalling of sovereign tribal government seeking information about its own citizens. Legal experts confirm ICE cannot hold U.S. citizens in immigration detention once citizenship is verified.
