> "His shoes fell off. He had his kitchen shoes on, and they knocked his shoes off. That was the part that kept haunting me—that he was detained and he didn't have shoes on."

Johnston noted that the kitchen manager is a white U.S. citizen, which has further increased fears among staff and customers that anyone can be detained, as violence against legal observers in Minnesota continues to escalate.
