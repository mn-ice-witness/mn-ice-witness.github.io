# Man Detained While Driving Sick Wife to Emergency Room

## Summary
Liborio Parral Ortiz was detained by ICE agents while driving his wife Bonfilia Sanchez Dominguez to the emergency room for severe back pain. Agents blocked their vehicle before they could reach Mercy Hospital Unity Campus in Fridley. Parral Ortiz was taken into custody and transported to El Paso, Texas within 20 hours—before his family could bring him his diabetes medication. His wife was taken to the hospital by ICE agents, but family members and her attorney were blocked from accessing her bedside.

## Witness Accounts
**Shelly (daughter):** "They got in front of their car and didn't let them go past. They started opening their doors and pulling them. They were not asking them any questions, they just started grabbing them."

Shelly reported that when she and her brother arrived at the hospital, ICE agents were stationed outside their mother's room. Hospital staff warned them that if they left, they would not be allowed to return to see their mother.

**Family attorney:** When the attorney attempted to speak with Sanchez Dominguez at the hospital, security staff threatened to arrest him.

## Related Incidents
This family was targeted in multiple ICE operations:
- **January 15, 2026:** Workers at El Tapatio restaurant in Willmar (owned by this couple) were detained after ICE agents ate lunch at the restaurant and followed employees after closing. See: [El Tapatio Willmar incident](2026-01-15-el-tapatio-willmar.md)

## Context
This incident is part of a broader pattern of ICE presence at Minnesota hospitals during Operation Metro Surge. Health care workers have reported ICE agents at Hennepin County Medical Center, Regions Hospital, and other facilities. At a Hennepin County Board of Commissioners meeting, medical staff expressed concern that ICE presence creates fear among patients and staff, potentially deterring people from seeking medical care.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Single news source (Sahan Journal) with detailed victim and family interviews. The GoFundMe campaign corroborates background details about the family. The story includes direct quotes from family members and specific timeline details. The connection to the well-documented El Tapatio incident (same family) adds credibility. Rating could be upgraded to HIGH if additional news outlets cover the story or if official records (ICE detainee locator confirmation) are documented.
