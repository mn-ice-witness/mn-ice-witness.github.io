# Two Detained Women Become First Responders After ICE Agent Has Seizure

## Summary
Tippy Amundson (39) and Heather Zemien (55), both U.S. citizens, were detained by ICE in Brooklyn Park. While being transported to Whipple Federal Building, an ICE agent had a seizure. The women recognized the emergency when the agents did not, directed them to call 911, and provided first aid after being uncuffed. Despite saving the agent's life, they were still taken to Whipple. Upon release, a commanding officer told them: "You need to tell everybody that we treated you kindly."

## Timeline
- Detained in Brooklyn Park on afternoon of Jan 22
- Being transported in three-row ICE SUV toward Whipple Federal Building
- Stopped at a traffic light when agent in front passenger seat said he wasn't feeling well
- Agent's body began to tilt, arms flailed, words became incoherent
- Amundson and Zemien recognized it as a seizure; told driver to pull over and call 911
- SUV pulled onto sidewalk near Welcome Avenue by an Aldi
- Amundson asked to be uncuffed; told agents "He's going to stop breathing"
- Agents stepped out, leaving driver's door open, engine running, keys inside, weapons in reach
- Amundson ran around car, knelt beside agent, turned him onto his side
- She moved his gun from holster to position him properly
- She cradled his head as he had more seizures
- Zemien grabbed a tactical vest, rolled it up, placed it under his head to keep airway open
- Agent had two more seizures
- Amundson said "We had to tell them every step of the way what to do"
- EMS arrived; women had been holding agent steady for several minutes
- Women were placed in another vehicle and taken to Whipple anyway
- Amundson asked if they could go home: "We just saved his life. Is that cool with you?" They said no.
- On the drive, Amundson asked about calling a lawyer; agent said they "should" be able to at Whipple but didn't know the policy
- Agent said because they helped, they could call one person
- Zemien called her attorney
- Amundson had texted her husband via voice command during detention; he contacted their state representative
- Commanding officer told them: "We're releasing you to your counsel and to your state representative. But you need to tell everybody that we treated you kindly."
- Released at front of Whipple Federal Building to their state representative's car

## Reason for Detention
Both women were advised by attorneys not to discuss why they were being held.

## Notable Details
- Amundson reflected: "I was hit so hard with the fact that this man would not do this for me"
- Her mind went immediately to Renee Good
- ICE did not respond to requests for information about the incident or questions about its medical and safety protocols

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Two independent sources (KARE 11 video, Star Tribune) with detailed on-the-record interviews from both affected individuals. ICE did not respond to requests for comment. The women were advised by attorneys not to discuss the reason for their detention, suggesting they may have been legal observers.
