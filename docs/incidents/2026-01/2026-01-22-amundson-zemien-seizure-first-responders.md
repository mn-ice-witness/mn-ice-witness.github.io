# Two Detained Women Become First Responders After ICE Agent Has Seizure

## Summary
Tippy Amundson (39) and Heather Zemien (55), both U.S. citizens, were detained by ICE in Brooklyn Park. While being transported to Whipple Federal Building, an ICE agent had a seizure. The women recognized the emergency when the agents did not, directed them to call 911, and provided first aid after being uncuffed. Despite saving the agent's life, they were still taken to Whipple. Upon release, a commanding officer told them: "You need to tell everybody that we treated you kindly."
