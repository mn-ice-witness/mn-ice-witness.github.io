# DOJ Declines Civil Rights Investigation into Good Shooting

## Summary
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced there is "no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation" into the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned in protest, citing DOJ pressure to investigate Good's activist ties rather than the shooting itself.

## Official Statements

### Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche
> "Federal agents risk their lives each day to safeguard our communities. They must make decisions, under dynamic and chaotic circumstances, in less time than it took to read this sentence."

> "The law does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm. Rather, they may use deadly force when they face an immediate threat of significant physical harm."

Blanche stated there is "currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation" into the killing.

### DOJ Civil Rights Division
Leadership in the Civil Rights Division, overseen by Harmeet Dhillon, informed staff there would not be an investigation into the shooting. Multiple career prosecutors offered to participate but were instructed not to do so.

## Prosecutor Resignations

Six federal prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota resigned, including:
- **Joseph Thompson** - Over a decade in law enforcement
- **Melinda Williams**
- Four additional attorneys (names not disclosed)

### Their Concerns
According to sources, the prosecutors had two main concerns:

1. **Pressure to investigate activist connections**: They felt "pressure from Justice Department leadership, both in Minneapolis and in Washington, to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow" rather than the shooting itself.

2. **Exclusion of state/local authorities**: They were concerned about "a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation."

## State Officials' Response

### Governor Tim Walz
Described Thompson as a "principled public servant" and called the resignations "a huge loss for our state," attributing them to Trump administration pressure on the DOJ.

### Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara
> "The legitimacy of the justice system depends on institutions—not rhetoric."

O'Hara noted that Thompson was directly responsible for the fraud cases now being cited by the federal government to justify Operation Metro Surge.

## Context

The decision to keep the DOJ's Civil Rights Division out of the investigation marks a departure from past administrations, which have moved to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

The FBI remains in sole control of the investigation. Federal investigators restricted Minnesota investigators' access to case materials.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - DOJ statement and prosecutor resignations well-documented across multiple news sources. The refusal to investigate and subsequent resignations are matters of public record.
