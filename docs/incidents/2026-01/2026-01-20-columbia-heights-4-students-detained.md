# Four Columbia Heights Students Detained by ICE, Including 5-Year-Old Sent to Texas

## Summary
Four students from Columbia Heights Public School District have been detained by ICE, including a 5-year-old kindergartner and a 10-year-old fourth grader who are now held in a Texas detention center with their parents. Superintendent Zena Stenvik held an emotional press conference on January 22, 2026, asking "Why detain a 5-year-old? You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal."
