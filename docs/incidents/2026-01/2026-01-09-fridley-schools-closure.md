## Official Accounts

### Fridley Public Schools (Superintendent Brenda Lewis, Ph.D.)

**January 8 announcement (first closure):**
> "Our community has experienced significant fear and disruption over the past 24 hours due to ICE activity in our community. We have listened closely to our students, families, and staff, and we are responding to the reality of what many are living through right now."

> "We are choosing to cancel school tomorrow because so many in our community are scared, unsure if it is safe to travel or leave home, and are experiencing very real trauma. We have seen a major spike in absences and staff availability as families and employees make the best decisions they can to protect themselves and their children."

> "We also know that for some families, the fear is more than emotional - it is physical, logistical, and deeply personal. We see you, and we are holding our community close in this moment."

**January 15 announcement (second closure):**
> "School will be canceled tomorrow, Friday, January 16, 2026, for all Fridley Public Schools. This is due to pending winter weather and federal immigration enforcement (ICE) activity in our community, which is impacting all school operations and causing fear among our students, staff, and families, resulting in significant disruption."

The district also announced an optional e-learning opportunity from January 20 through February 13 for families who feel more comfortable with remote learning during this time.

### Fridley School Board (December 2025)
The Fridley Public Schools Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution on December 16, 2025, affirming that the district would continue to protect private student information and refuse to grant access to immigration enforcement without a valid judicial warrant.

## What Was Cancelled (Both Closures)
- All school for all students
- Online or distance learning
- All after-school, evening, and weekend activities
- Building rentals
- All Community Education classes
- Tiger Club childcare

## Context
The closures came after:
1. Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis (January 7, 2026)
2. Border Patrol agents entered Roosevelt High School grounds, detained a staff member, and deployed chemical irritants (January 7, 2026)
3. A surge of more than 2,000 federal agents deployed to the Twin Cities area

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple mainstream media sources (FOX 9, KARE 11, Bring Me The News, Hometown Source) reported on this incident. Direct correspondence from the school district provides primary source documentation of the closures and the superintendent's statements explaining the decisions.
