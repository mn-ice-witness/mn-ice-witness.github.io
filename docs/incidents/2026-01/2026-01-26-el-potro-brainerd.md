## Official Accounts

### Crow Wing County Sheriff's Office
Chief Deputy Andy Bradley: "We had two people with felony arrest warrants in the building, so we went in with Homeland Security and did that."

The sheriff's office press release stated deputies "were asked to assist a Homeland Security Investigation team with executing two federal arrest warrants" but provided "no clarity about why four people were arrested, if there were just two arrest warrants."

### ICE/DHS
ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

## Community Response
On the evening of January 27, approximately 40 community members gathered for a candlelight vigil outside El Potro despite frigid temperatures.

Rev. Leslie Moughty of First Congregational United Church of Christ led the vigil: "We are here to stand up for the humanity of every person."

Attorney Ed Shaw noted the broader impact: "They started a business in a struggling area...now we have another vacant building."

Signs in the restaurant windows read "Thank you for all your kindness and continued support!! We will never forget it. Stay strong."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent local news sources (Brainerd Dispatch, KAXE public radio) with official statements from Crow Wing County Sheriff's Office. Well-documented workplace enforcement action with unexplained discrepancy between number of warrants (2) and arrests (4).
