# 50+ ICE Agents Swarm Somali Mall in St. Cloud; Chemical Irritants Used on Protesters

## Summary
More than 50 ICE agents descended on Star City Mall, a strip mall with numerous Somali-owned businesses, to arrest one man leaving a deli. Hundreds of protesters gathered and blocked ICE vehicles, leading to a tense standoff. Agents deployed chemical irritants on the crowd. Three total arrests: one ICE target, two protesters. The incident came two days after Somali business owners at the same location successfully shouted ICE agents into leaving.

## What Happened

### The Arrest
ICE agents detained a man coming out of a deli at Star City Mall around midday on January 12, 2026.

### Community Response
- People started gathering immediately after witnessing the arrest
- Local Somali news station XIDIG TV posted live video, drawing more people to the scene
- Hundreds of protesters arrived and blocked ICE vehicles in the parking lot
- State Sen. Aric Putnam acted as shield between protesters and agents, urging calm

### Use of Force
When protesters refused to allow ICE vehicles to leave, agents deployed chemical irritant on the crowd. XIDIG TV journalist Mohamed Jama reported witnessing agents "shoving and pepper-spraying protesters and even bystanders."

### Two Days Earlier (Jan 10)
In the same parking lot, Somali business owners and patrons confronted ICE agents so forcefully that the federal officers drove away without making arrests. Video of this incident went viral.

## Arrests
- **1** - Target of ICE operation (man from deli)
- **2** - Protesters arrested in parking lot

## Officials Present
- **St. Cloud City Council Member Hudda Ibrahim** - arrived after alert about ~80 agents
- **State Sen. Aric Putnam (D-St. Cloud)** - acted as mediator

## Official Statements

### St. Cloud Police
"Police had no advance notice of the federal operation and focused on ensuring public safety while allowing peaceful First Amendment expression."

### Mohamed Jama (XIDIG TV Journalist)
"This is such a tragedy that people are being used as scapegoats... Even businesses are being targeted."

## Context
The operation occurred as the Department of Homeland Security pledged to send 2,000+ immigration officers into Minnesota in what ICE called its "largest enforcement operation ever." The same day, Minnesota and the Twin Cities sued the Trump administration to halt the surge.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple major news sources (Star Tribune, CBS, CNN, local radio) with video evidence. Named witnesses and officials on record. Chemical irritant use documented. Clear pattern of ICE targeting Somali business districts.
