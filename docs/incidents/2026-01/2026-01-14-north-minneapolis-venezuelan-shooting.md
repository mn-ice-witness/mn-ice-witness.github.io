# ICE Agent Shoots Venezuelan Man in North Minneapolis; Tear Gas Deployed on Protesters, Children Hospitalized

## Summary
On January 14, 2026, exactly one week after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, an ICE agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg during an arrest operation in north Minneapolis. DHS claims the agent was "ambushed" by three men with shovels after a traffic stop. Hundreds of protesters gathered at the scene, leading to clashes with law enforcement who deployed tear gas, flash bangs, and pepper balls. Two children, including a 6-month-old infant, were hospitalized after exposure to tear gas. President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in response.

## Official Accounts

### DHS Statement (Secretary Kristi Noem)
"What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement. Our officer was ambushed and attacked by three individuals who beat him with snow shovels and the handles of brooms. Fearing for his life, the officer fired a defensive shot."

### President Trump
Threatened on Truth Social to invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians "don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E."

### Governor Tim Walz
In prime-time address: Called on Trump administration to "end this occupation." Encouraged residents: "Take out that phone and hit record."

### Mayor Jacob Frey
Called the situation "not sustainable," stating the presence of ~3,000 ICE agents was "creating chaos."

## Law Enforcement Response to Protesters
- Tear gas canisters deployed
- Flash bangs used
- Pepper balls fired
- Unlawful assembly declared
- Clashes continued into early morning hours

## Context
- Second ICE shooting in Minneapolis in one week (first: Renee Good, January 7)

## Disputed Elements
DHS claims Sosa-Celis had prior convictions, but CBS Minnesota noted "their shared background of him lists only minor prior incidents" (driving without license, false name to officer).

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple major national and local news sources (NPR, CNN, Fox News, CBS, Fox 9). Official DHS and Governor statements. Video evidence of aftermath. Documented hospitalizations of children. Second shooting in a week in same city by same agency.
