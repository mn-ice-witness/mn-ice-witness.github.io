## Victim(s)

- **Name:** Unknown
- **Status:** Pinned to ground by multiple agents, pepper sprayed directly in face

## Context: Federal Injunction on Chemical Irritants

On January 17, 2026, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez issued a preliminary injunction barring federal agents participating in Operation Metro Surge from using pepper spray on peaceful protesters and observers. The court found that chemical agents had been used against protesters on at least four separate occasions and that "protected conduct—including peaceful protesting and observation—had motivated the agents' actions."

This incident occurred four days after that injunction was issued.
