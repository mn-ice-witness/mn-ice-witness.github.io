# Attorneys Denied Access to Detained Clients at Whipple Building

## Summary
Multiple attorneys allege the Department of Homeland Security is denying detainees their constitutional right to legal counsel at the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis. Four attorneys report being denied access to their clients, including one U.S. citizen and Iraq War veteran detained as a bystander. ICE agents cite reasons attorneys say have no legal basis, including "we don't do attorney visitation."

## Attorney Accounts

### Robert Sicoli, Criminal Defense Attorney
"There's nothing in the Constitution that talks about accommodating the government. It is a violation of constitutional rights."

Sicoli was told he could not see his client, a U.S. citizen and Iraq War veteran who was a bystander to an enforcement operation, because the client "had not requested me by name."

"I've been practicing law in Minnesota for almost 20 years, and I have never been denied access to a client," Sicoli told ABC News.

### Anonymous Immigration Attorney
"ICE agents were physically restricting me from seeing them. I stood outside the attorney visitation room for about four hours on Thursday, trying to see one of my clients who had been there for multiple days. I kept saying, you got to let me see my client. And they just kept repeating, we don't do attorney visitation."

The attorney said they have visited clients at the Whipple building for the last decade without issue. The visitation denials of the past week are "new and unprecedented."

### Third Anonymous Attorney
Described trying to see a detained client with severe medical concerns who needs specific medications: "I told them I needed to at least confirm that my client received the medications he needs, and they would not let me see him."

### Reasons Given for Denial
Attorneys report receiving various explanations:
- No scheduled appointments
- Client did not request attorney by name
- Facility cannot accommodate attorney-client visits
- "One ICE agent said if we let you see your clients, we would have to let all the attorneys see their clients, and imagine the chaos"

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
DHS spokesperson statement to ABC News:

> "All detainees have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. Illegal aliens in detention have access to phones they can use to contact their families and lawyers. ICE gives all illegal aliens arrested a court-approved list of free or low-cost attorneys. All detainees receive full due process."

### Attorneys' Response to DHS
All attorneys ABC News spoke to called the DHS denial "a blatant lie."

One attorney stated: "If ICE is trying to say, 'Oh, it's fine, you can just have your client call you and you can talk and discuss their case over the phone,' that's absolutely unacceptable from an attorney-client standpoint. [Federal authorities] can and likely are listening in to those phone calls."

## Legal Context
The attorneys allege these denials violate the 5th and 6th Amendment rights to due process and the right to consult with counsel. While immigration violations are civil rather than criminal offenses and detainees do not have an automatic right to appointed counsel, they retain the right to access an attorney they have retained.
