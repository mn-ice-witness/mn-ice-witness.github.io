# Citizen Check: U.S. Citizen Surrounded by ICE Agents at West St. Paul Restaurant

## Summary
Irma Escoto, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico, was surrounded by ICE agents while sitting in her car outside El Taquito Taco Shop in West St. Paul. Her husband Luis Escoto, a naturalized citizen since 1992, rushed outside with her passport card to prove her citizenship. The couple co-owns the restaurant and believes she was targeted based on her appearance.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Irma Escoto
- **Citizenship:** U.S. citizen (born in New Mexico)
- **Occupation:** Co-owner of El Taquito Taco Shop
- **Spouse:** Luis Escoto (naturalized U.S. citizen since 1992, originally from Mexico)

## What Happened
On Sunday afternoon, Luis Escoto realized ICE agents were surrounding his wife's car. With images of the ICE shooting of Renee Good fresh in his head, he rushed outside with her passport card, knowing his wife was born in the United States.

Restaurant security footage and video from a bystander show multiple ICE vehicles seemingly focused on a business next door when three masked agents came to Irma's driver's side window.

The family believes she was targeted based on her appearance.

## Official Response
WCCO reached out to ICE for more information. The agency has not responded.

## Context
This incident is part of a documented pattern of U.S. citizens being subjected to citizenship checks during Operation Metro Surge. The encounter prompted the Escoto family to have documentation readily available, reflecting the fear among American citizens in Minnesota of being stopped based on their appearance.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence (restaurant security footage, bystander video). Named affected individuals (Irma and Luis Escoto) with direct quotes in established local outlet (CBS Minnesota/WCCO). Business owners willing to speak publicly about the incident.
