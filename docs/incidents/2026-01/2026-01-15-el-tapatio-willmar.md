## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
The Department of Homeland Security declined to respond to media inquiries about who was arrested or why.

### Local Officials
Willmar Mayor Doug Reese urged residents to stay calm and respect one another for community safety.

## Witness Accounts
An anonymous eyewitness who feared retribution shared photos from inside the restaurant and video of the arrests with the Minnesota Star Tribune. The eyewitness reported that staff were "frightened" when the four ICE agents sat down for lunch.

A handful of bystanders witnessed the arrests and confronted the agents:
- Blew whistles during the detention
- One bystander asked: "Would your mama be proud of you right now?"

Abdullahi Mohamed, a Willmar resident: "You have families that are scared for their life. People refusing to come out of their house."

Brentt Fees, who works nearby: "They detained someone just across the street where I was working... I just wanted to make sure everything is okay. And apparently it's not."

A liquor store worker in Willmar reported losing 75% of business since the ICE operation began.

## Context
Willmar is a city of approximately 21,000 people in Kandiyohi County, about 85 miles west of Minneapolis. Approximately 40% of the population are people of color, with about one-third identifying as Hispanic. The city is home to the Jennie-O Turkey Store processing facility and has a diverse immigrant population including Latino, Somali, and Karen communities. Kandiyohi County voted nearly 65% for President Trump in 2024.

This incident is part of increased ICE activity in Willmar, which has included:
- A 19-year-old Somali woman with legal refugee status arrested in downtown Willmar on Monday (Jan 13)
- An arrest at Jennie-O Turkey Store during a shift change (Jan 13)
- Another young woman arrested in downtown Willmar (video captured by onlookers)

## Social Media Response
The incident drew widespread condemnation on social media, with users describing the tactic as "depraved" and "diabolical." The story was covered by numerous national and international outlets.

## Related Incidents
The restaurant owners were targeted in a separate ICE operation the following day:
- **January 16, 2026:** Liborio Parral Ortiz was detained while driving his wife Bonfilia Sanchez Dominguez to the emergency room in Mounds View. He was transported to El Paso, Texas within 20 hours. See: [Parral Ortiz Hospital Detention](#2026-01-16-parral-ortiz-hospital-detention)

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - 7+ independent news sources including the original Star Tribune reporting, local Willmar outlets (West Central Tribune, KWLM Radio), CBS Minnesota, and multiple national outlets. Eyewitness provided photos from the restaurant and video of the arrests. Multiple witness accounts corroborate the timeline. CBS Minnesota confirmed the owners were among those detained. The restaurant being closed on Friday with no reopening date corroborates the community impact.
