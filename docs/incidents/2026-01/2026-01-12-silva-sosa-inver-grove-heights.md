# Silva Sosa Parents Detained Days After I-130 Approval

## Summary
A couple who have lived in Minnesota since 1999 were detained by ICE during a traffic stop in Inver Grove Heights while on their way to work. Five days before the detention, they had received approval on their I-130 petition after working with an immigration lawyer for three years. Their three daughters - Kelsy, Cecilia, and Kimberly Silva Sosa - are now fighting to get their parents released from an El Paso, Texas ICE detention facility. The father is diabetic and the family is uncertain if he is receiving his medication. <em class="incident-note">**Note: This story seems to follow a pattern of Operation PARRIS (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) -- see more details on this below.**</em>

## Family Statements

### Cecilia Silva Sosa (daughter, DACA recipient)
> "Our parents are not criminals, they've never done anything."

> "They were actually on their way to work, I think they were, what, like a mile or two away from our house, so they had just left and they got pulled over."

> "I want to say this is not a political issue."

### Kimberly Silva Sosa (daughter)
> "Mexico is very poor. Every Hispanic person knows that, the American dream, they wanted to come here."

> "Five days before they got detained, our dad sent us the case number saying that they got approved so they can get processed for their naturalization."

### Kelsy Silva Sosa (daughter)
> "She said that she was OK and that they're getting fed three times a day. She was like, 'Don't worry about us, I just want to make sure that you guys are OK.'"

### Cecilia's Facebook Comment (additional context)
> "They had just gotten approval for their I-130 form, which can take years to complete. They have been working with a new immigration lawyer for 3 years, and had a case number. They have a LLC and have paid taxes since 1999. They don't get handouts from the government, you need a SSN for that. They have something called an ITIN number to file taxes. You need to be a US citizen in order to vote here in the US. I am a DACA recipient, which does NOT allow me to vote here."

## Family Background
The parents met at a dance club in Mexico in the 1980s. They moved to Minnesota in 1999 seeking economic opportunity and built a thriving office cleaning business. They have paid taxes using an ITIN since 1999 and operate a registered LLC. They do not receive government benefits (which require SSN). One daughter is a DACA recipient.

## Context: Operation PARRIS

The Silva Sosa parents' detention fits a documented pattern of ICE targeting immigrants with pending green card applications under **Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening). According to [Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-fraud-dhs-launching-operation-parris-target-refugees-jan-9), approximately 5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota are being targeted through this [official DHS operation](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota).

The timing of this detention is particularly notable: the family received I-130 approval just **5 days before** ICE detained them, after working with an immigration lawyer for three years.

[Global Refuge](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) has documented that lawfully present immigrants are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - CBS Minnesota/WCCO feature story with extensive family interviews and video. The timing of detention - 5 days after I-130 approval following 3 years of working with immigration lawyers - is particularly notable. Family has documented 26+ years in Minnesota, tax compliance, business ownership, and active immigration case. Medical concerns (diabetic father) add urgency.
