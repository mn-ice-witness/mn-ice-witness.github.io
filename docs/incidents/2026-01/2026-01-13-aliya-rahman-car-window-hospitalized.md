## Context
The incident occurred as 2,400+ DHS agents deployed to Minnesota, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announcing "hundreds more" in response to protests following Renee Good's killing.

## Rahman's Statement
> "Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled."

> "It was not until I lost consciousness in my cell that I was finally taken to a hospital."

> "My trip to the Traumatic Brain Injury Center turned into an assault by federal agents."

## Attorney's Statement
Alexa Van Brunt, Rahman's attorney and director of the MacArthur Justice Center:
> "Her only options were to move her car forward in the direction of ICE officers and risk being accused of trying to harm them—which led to Renee Good's death—or stay stationary, which in the end led to physical violence and abuse."

## DHS Response
A DHS spokesperson disputed Rahman's account, claiming she was an "agitator" who "ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene." DHS said she was arrested along with six other people they called agitators. DHS did not respond to questions about denying her medical treatment.

## Official Response
State Senator Omar Fateh wrote on X: "This is what living under a federal siege looks like. This isn't about public safety—this is terrorism."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence from multiple sources shows the incident clearly. Affected individual publicly identified. Hospitalization and assault injuries confirmed by legal counsel. Multiple independent news outlets verified and published footage. Video went viral with millions of views.
