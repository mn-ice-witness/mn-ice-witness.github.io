# ICE Agents "Ripping People From Cars" at Bus Stop; Union Marks Site as "Abduction" Location

## Summary
On January 10, 2026, ICE agents created a chaotic scene at a bus stop at 31st Street and Bloomington Avenue South in Minneapolis, blocking traffic, "ripping people from their cars," and using "excessive force" according to a Metro Transit bus operator who witnessed the incident. The scene caused anxiety and fear for transit workers and passengers. The Amalgamated Transit Union later held a rally at the site, posting a sign reading "Minnesotans were abducted here."

## Witness Account

### Metro Transit Bus Operator
According to ATU Local 1005 President David Stiggers, a bus operator witnessed ICE agents:
- "Ripping people from their cars"
- Using "excessive force"
- Blocking traffic
- Removing individuals from vehicles
- Blocking the bus from proceeding through the intersection

The incident happened in broad daylight and "caused a ton of anxiety and fear" for the operator and everyone who witnessed it.

## Union Response

### January 14 Rally
On January 14, 2026, Metro Transit workers and allies gathered at the corner of Bloomington and 31st Street, holding up a sign that read:

**"Minnesotans were abducted here"**

### Union Statement
David Stiggers, ATU 1005 President, stated:
- ICE activity is "a throwback to the darkest times of human history, 1940s Germany"
- Bus drivers have the right to refuse to open doors for masked, unidentified agents
- Armed agents without identification pose safety risks to operators and passengers

### Protocol for Bus Operators
Stiggers announced that current protocol allows:
- Drivers to refuse opening doors to perceived threats
- Treating masked, armed agents without identification as a safety risk
- Protecting both operators and passengers from unauthorized boarding

## Context
This incident occurred during Operation Metro Surge, with approximately 3,000 federal agents deployed to the Minneapolis area. It came three days after the fatal shooting of Renee Good and demonstrates the expansion of ICE tactics into public transit areas.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Named union official (David Stiggers) on record. Multiple news sources (Workday Magazine, Sahan Journal). Documented union press conference and rally. Physical marker ("abducted here" sign) placed at location. Part of documented pattern of aggressive tactics at public locations.
