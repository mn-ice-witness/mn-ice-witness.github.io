# ICE Agents Staying at Hotel Arrest One of Its Employees

## Summary
A Nicaraguan refugee working at the Hilton Homewood Suites in St. Louis Park was arrested by ICE agents who were staying at the hotel as guests. The man had a valid work permit through 2029 and entered the U.S. legally as a refugee in October 2023. Despite agents being informed of his legal status, they detained him as part of Operation PARRIS. A federal judge ordered his immediate release on January 25, 2026, noting the "Orwellian situation" created by bureaucratic delays.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Citizenship:** Nicaraguan refugee
- **Entry:** Entered U.S. legally as refugee in October 2023
- **Work authorization:** Valid work permit through 2029
- **Criminal record:** None indicated
- **Employer:** Hilton Homewood Suites, St. Louis Park

## What Happened
- ICE agents deployed to Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge were staying at the Hilton Homewood Suites
- On January 19, agents arrested one of the hotel's employees
- The employee filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration stating he is a citizen of Nicaragua, entered the U.S. as a refugee, and has a valid work permit through 2029
- Despite agents being made aware of his legal status, they arrested him as part of Operation PARRIS
- He was transported to El Paso Camp East Montana in Texas despite a court order that he could not be moved from Minnesota without speaking to an attorney

## Court Ruling (January 25, 2026)
U.S. District Judge Susan Nelson ruled the man must be released immediately. In her ruling, Judge Nelson noted:
- Refugees cannot apply for permanent resident status for at least a year after arrival
- The man had already applied for permanent residency but was waiting on USCIS approval
- Federal officials claimed his arrest was justified because he had been in the U.S. as a refugee for more than a year without becoming a lawful permanent resident

Judge Nelson wrote: "This Orwellian situation, in which a lawfully admitted refugee's personal liberty hangs in the balance, is rooted in USCIS's delay."

## Context
This arrest was part of Operation PARRIS (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening), the Trump administration's initiative targeting approximately 5,600 Minnesota refugees whose status is being re-examined.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Federal court ruling confirms detention and orders release. Lawsuit filed with specific details about legal status. Multiple news sources confirm incident. Judge's written opinion provides official documentation of the circumstances.
