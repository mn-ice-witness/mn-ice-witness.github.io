# DHS Blames Mayor Frey's Sanctuary Policies for Criminal Release

## Summary
DHS issued a statement criticizing Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's sanctuary city policies, claiming they have resulted in the release of "nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens" back onto Minnesota streets since President Trump took office. The statement centered on a vehicular homicide case as evidence for why sanctuary policies are "dangerous."

## Official Statements

### DHS Key Claims
- Governor Walz and Mayor Frey have "refused to cooperate with ICE" since President Trump took office
- **470** "criminal illegal aliens" allegedly released back onto streets
- Sanctuary policies are "dangerous" and enable reoffending

### DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin
> "Mayor Frey's dangerous sanctuary policies directly RELEASE criminal illegal aliens from jails and put them back on the streets to victimize more innocent Americans."

### Featured Case
DHS centered the statement on German Llangari Inga, an Ecuadorian national charged with vehicular homicide in the death of Victoria Eileen Harwell in August 2024. According to DHS:
- Arrested August 4, 2024 with blood alcohol "more than twice the legal limit"
- ICE placed a detainer
- Hennepin County Jail "refused to honor the detainer"
- Released August 6, 2024 "without notification to ICE"
- Re-arrested May 2025, again released May 13 "without notification to ICE"
- ICE apprehended him May 16, 2025

### Mayor Frey's Response
In a Fox News interview, Mayor Frey stated:
> "If you commit a crime...you should be investigated, charged, prosecuted, held accountable, and yes, arrested and put in jail."

## Context

### Legal Background on ICE Detainers
ICE detainers are administrative requests — not judicial warrants — asking local law enforcement to hold individuals beyond their scheduled release. Many jurisdictions limit cooperation because:
- Federal courts have ruled that honoring detainers without judicial warrants may violate the Fourth Amendment
- Holding people beyond their release date without warrants raises due process concerns
- Community trust issues: immigrant communities may avoid reporting crimes or cooperating with police if they fear immigration consequences

### Pattern of Administration Messaging
This statement follows a consistent DHS pattern of highlighting individual criminal cases to justify broader enforcement operations. The administration has issued similar statements in response to criticism of:
- The shooting death of Renee Good by an ICE agent (Jan 7)
- Arrests at schools and churches
- Detention of U.S. citizens and legal residents
- Use of force against observers and bystanders

### Contested Premise
The DHS framing conflates sanctuary policies with support for criminal activity. However:
- Individuals with criminal charges are still prosecuted through the criminal justice system
- Sanctuary policies affect whether local jails assist with *immigration* enforcement, not criminal enforcement
- The featured case involves an individual who *was* charged, prosecuted, and facing criminal justice proceedings

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS press release. The statement represents the federal government's position on sanctuary city policies. The featured criminal case is cited to support policy arguments; readers should note this is a single case used to characterize broader policy impacts. The statement continues DHS's pattern of responding to criticism of enforcement operations by highlighting criminal cases.
