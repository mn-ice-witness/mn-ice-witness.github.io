# Bovino: "We Are Experts in Dealing With Children"

## Summary

At a press conference in Minneapolis on January 23, 2026, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino defended ICE's detention of children, declaring "We are experts in dealing with children. Not because we want to be, but because we have to be." The remarks came amid national outrage over the detention of a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old in Minneapolis earlier that week. ICE official Marcos Charles also accused the 5-year-old's father of "abandoning his child" during the arrest.

## Official Statements

### Gregory Bovino (Border Patrol Commander at Large, Minneapolis)

At a press conference outside Minneapolis on January 23, Bovino addressed criticism of ICE's handling of children during enforcement operations:

> "I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children. Let me say that again: experts in dealing with children, not because we want to be, but because we have to be."

Bovino claimed ICE and Border Patrol officers are "probably the most experienced law enforcement agencies anywhere in the United States" when dealing with children, citing hundreds of thousands of children who have passed through federal custody in recent years.

He described anecdotes of "agents in the back parking lot playing soccer matches with those children" and challenged: "I would challenge any law enforcement agency to show me the fantastic care that ICE and U.S. Border Patrol provide children."

On 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos's detention:

> "That child is in the least restrictive setting possible. That 5-year-old remains with his family. Let me say that again: remains with his family."

Bovino dismissed criticism of the detention as a "false media narrative" and stated that federal enforcement operations would continue "unabated."

### Marcos Charles (ICE Official, Minneapolis)

At the same press conference, ICE official Marcos Charles accused Liam's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, of abandoning his son:

> "He and his child were in a vehicle. Arias fled from law enforcement on foot, abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle."

Charles described what happened after the father was apprehended:

> "My officers cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-through restaurant and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of. Not his father."

Charles said officers tried to return Liam to his family: "Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door."

When asked about the father's criminal record, Charles said he would provide that information later.

## Context: "Using a Child as Bait" Allegation

The press conference came in response to an allegation from Columbia Heights school officials that ICE agents used Liam as "bait" during the January 20 arrest. Superintendent Zena Stenvik reported that agents led the 5-year-old to knock on his family's front door to see if anyone else was home.

School officials disputed ICE's account:
- Another adult in the home "begged the agents to let him take care of the small child, and was refused"
- The family had an active asylum case and no deportation order
- Immigration attorney Marc Prokosch said the family had presented themselves at a Texas border port to apply for asylum and "did everything right"

## Contested Claims from Immigrant Advocates

Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School's immigration clinic, challenged Bovino's characterization:

> "Border Patrol officers and ICE agents have proven time and again that they are incapable of providing children with appropriate care. They insist on detaining children for prolonged periods of time without access to clean water, edible food and educational and recreational opportunities."

Mukherjee noted that during Trump's first term, thousands of families were separated under a deterrence policy, with hundreds still separated years later. She also cited children, including infants, being placed in "overcrowded, fetid border patrol facilities for weeks."

## Legal Context

A 1997 legal settlement (the Flores Agreement) requires the U.S. government to provide children with "safe and sanitary conditions" and to prioritize their prompt release. The Trump administration asked the federal judge overseeing the agreement to terminate it; the judge denied the motion, and the government has appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
