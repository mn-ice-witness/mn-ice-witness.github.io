# Liberian Man Arrested With Battering Ram, No Judicial Warrant

## Summary
Garrison Gibson, a 38-year-old Liberian citizen who has lived in the U.S. for approximately 20 years, was arrested by ICE agents who used a battering ram to enter his north Minneapolis home. His family demanded to see a judicial warrant, but agents presented only an administrative warrant signed by an immigration officer. A 9-year-old child was inside the home during the raid. Gibson's attorneys have filed a habeas petition challenging the arrest.

## Background
According to court filings, Gibson has resided in the U.S. for approximately two decades. Four years prior, immigration officials placed him under supervision.

He had checked in with ICE officials approximately two weeks before the arrest.

## The Warrant Issue
- Family alleges agents presented only an administrative warrant signed by an immigration officer, not a judge
- Immigration attorney Julia Decker: "The established rule is ICE needs a judicial warrant — signed by a judge in order to enter a residence."
- Attorney Marc Prokosch: "Any American should be terrified by that because that is such an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment."
- Prokosch: "To see a battering ram coming to the front door of your house with a 9-year-old inside is just terrifying."

## Official Accounts

### DHS Statement
The Department of Homeland Security said Gibson is a "criminal illegal alien" with a felony record. His attorney disputes this characterization, noting the conviction has been cleared.

## Legal Response
