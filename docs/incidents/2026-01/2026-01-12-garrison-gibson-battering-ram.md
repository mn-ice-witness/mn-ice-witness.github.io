# Liberian Man Arrested With Battering Ram, No Judicial Warrant

## Updates
- **Jan 18** - Added Jan 18 press conference: trophy photos allegation, overcrowded cell, Stephen Miller re-arrest claim
- **Jan 18** - Gibson re-arrested at check-in, then released again after ICE admits error; now on ankle monitor
- **Jan 18** - Federal judge rules arrest violated Fourth Amendment, orders release

## Summary
Garrison Gibson, a 38-year-old Liberian citizen who has lived in the U.S. for approximately 20 years, was arrested by ICE agents who used a battering ram to enter his north Minneapolis home. His family demanded to see a judicial warrant, but agents presented only an administrative warrant signed by an immigration officer. A 9-year-old child was inside the home during the raid. A federal judge ruled the arrest violated Gibson's Fourth Amendment rights and ordered his immediate release, finding he has "no criminal record" — contradicting DHS claims. Gibson was released but taken back into ICE custody the next day. At a Jan 18 press conference, Gibson alleged agents took "trophy photos" of him and held him in an overcrowded cell. He now wears an ankle monitor and says he is afraid to leave his home.

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Garrison Gibson
- **Age:** 37
- **Origin:** Liberia (fled civil war as a child)
- **Citizenship:** Under ICE supervision
- **Status:** Final immigration removal order from 2008; lived under order of supervision with regular check-ins
- **Criminal History:** 2008 third-degree narcotics sales conviction was later dismissed by courts. Court records show legal history dominated by traffic violations, minor drug arrests, and one arrest for riding public transit without paying fare.
- **Family:** Wife Teyana Gibson Brown (nurse) and 9-year-old child in the home during raid

## Background
According to court filings, Gibson has resided in the U.S. for approximately two decades. Four years prior, immigration officials placed him under supervision. The filing notes: "At no point has he ever been deemed a danger to his community, a flight risk, or has he been convicted of any new crime warranting his detention."

He had checked in with ICE officials approximately two weeks before the arrest.

## Timeline

- **Entry** - Agents use battering ram to break down door
- **Arrest** - Gibson taken into custody
- **Within 24 hours** - Habeas petition filed in federal court
- **After arrest** - Gibson flown to Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas

- **Jan 18, 2026** - Gibson holds press conference, alleges "trophy photos" and overcrowded cell

## The Warrant Issue
- Family alleges agents presented only an administrative warrant signed by an immigration officer, not a judge
- Immigration attorney Julia Decker: "The established rule is ICE needs a judicial warrant — signed by a judge in order to enter a residence."
- Attorney Marc Prokosch: "Any American should be terrified by that because that is such an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment."
- Prokosch: "To see a battering ram coming to the front door of your house with a 9-year-old inside is just terrifying."

## Official Accounts

### DHS Statement
DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin claimed Gibson has a "lengthy rap sheet (that) includes robbery, drug possession with intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft." She did not indicate whether those were arrests, charges, or convictions.

Court records contradict this characterization, showing his legal history is dominated by traffic violations, minor drug arrests, and one fare evasion charge. His only felony—the 2008 third-degree narcotics conviction—was later dismissed by the courts.

### Family Statement
Abena Abraham, speaking on behalf of the family: "This is unacceptable; this trauma to the family was really unnecessary."

Abraham also claimed that ICE officials told her on Jan 17 that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller ordered Gibson to be re-arrested. The White House denied this account.

## Detention Conditions (Jan 18 Press Conference)
At a press conference on Saturday, Jan 18, Gibson made the following allegations about his treatment during detention:
- ICE agents took unwanted "trophy photos" of him
- He was locked in an overcrowded cell
- Gibson: "I don't leave the house" — describing his current fear of going outside
- Gibson: "If I was a violent person, I would not have been out these past 17 years, checking in."
- He wore a shirt reading "Immigrants make America great" at the press conference

## Legal Response
- Habeas petition filed within 24 hours of arrest
- Judge ordered DHS not to move Gibson pending their response
- Legal team argues Fourth Amendment violation for warrantless entry
- **Jan 16, 2026:** Federal Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled ICE violated Gibson's Fourth Amendment rights by entering his home with only an administrative warrant, not a judicial warrant
- Judge ordered immediate release, stating: "This arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. For this independent reason, Garrison G.'s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release."
- Judge also found: "Garrison G. has no criminal record" — directly contradicting DHS claims of a "lengthy rap sheet"
- Gibson released Thursday night (Jan 16)
- **Jan 17, 2026:** Gibson back in ICE custody again when he appeared for routine immigration check-in
- **Jan 17, 2026 (evening):** Gibson released for second time after ICE admitted error. Attorney Marc Prokosch: "In the words of my client, he said that somebody at ICE said they bleeped up and so they re-released him this afternoon."
- **Current status:** Gibson now required to wear ankle monitor and remains under immigration supervision

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent sources including FOX 9, KSTP, and MPR News. Video evidence of the raid exists. Court filings provide documentation. Attorney statements on record. The warrant issue is clearly documented with legal expert analysis.
