## Victim(s)
- **Names:** Unknown (at least 6 employees)
- **Citizenship:** Had proper work authorization
- **Occupation:** Airport workers (hospitality, transportation)

## Details

### UNITE HERE Local 17 Statement
The hospitality union says ICE has been allowed to operate beyond the security gates at the airport and six of their employees—all of whom have authorization to work in the U.S.—have been "snatched" by agents.

### SEIU Local 26 Statement
They have not been able to make contact with four of these employees since they were detained.

### Union Representatives
"All of these workers that were kidnapped, had the proper work authorizations to be working in America, in our airport, behind security. They're doing it the right way. They're doing the legal way."

"Uber drivers are continuously harassed and snatched away, leaving abandoned cars behind. Their families completely unaware of where they are."

## Deportation Flights
Two busloads of detained immigrants were loaded onto a private jet at MSP Airport on Friday. Deportation flights are leaving via private airline companies such as GlobalX, with detainees ushered onto jets outside Signature Aviation.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Union statements from UNITE HERE Local 17 and SEIU Local 26 provide institutional credibility. However, individual victims not identified. Workplace raid at major transportation hub.
