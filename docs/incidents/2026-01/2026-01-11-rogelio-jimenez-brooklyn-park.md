# U.S. Citizen Detained by ICE in Brooklyn Park, Told to "Prove" Citizenship

## Summary
Rogelio Jimenez, a U.S. citizen, was forcibly removed from his car by masked ICE agents on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park. Despite repeatedly screaming that he was a citizen, an agent demanded he "prove it." He was handcuffed, placed in a federal vehicle, and driven around for approximately 20 minutes before being released. Agents claimed they were looking for someone with the same name.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Rogelio Jimenez
- **Citizenship:** U.S. citizen
- **Heritage:** Mexican-American
- **Vehicle:** Had Mexican flag decals

## What Happened
Video from Jimenez's dashboard camera, his cell phone, and a bystander's cell phone show multiple masked agents forcing him out of his car on Brooklyn Boulevard. He screamed multiple times that he is a U.S. citizen. An ICE agent responded by demanding he "prove it."

The agents handcuffed Jimenez and placed him in the back of a federal vehicle. Jimenez reported injuries to his arms and wrists from the encounter.

He was driven around for approximately 20 minutes before being released. His car was returned to him a short distance from where he was detained.

## ICE Explanation
An agent told Jimenez they were looking for someone with the same name.

## Affected Individual's Statement
Jimenez believes he was targeted in part for his Mexican heritage and the Mexican flag decals on his vehicle.

## Official Response
WCCO reached out to ICE for more information. The agency has not responded.

## Context
This incident is part of a documented pattern of ICE detaining U.S. citizens during Operation Metro Surge. WCCO has documented multiple instances where ICE has detained and, at times, physically harmed American citizens in Minnesota since the operation began.

U.S. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino stated that people who are in the country legally "shouldn't be concerned," but dozens of similar reports on social media have prompted many Americans in Minnesota to carry passports and other legal documents out of fear of being stopped.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence from multiple angles (dashcam, cell phone, bystander). Named affected individual (Rogelio Jimenez) with direct quotes in established local outlet (CBS Minnesota/WCCO). ICE has not responded to request for comment.
