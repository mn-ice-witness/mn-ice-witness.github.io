## Official Accounts

### Willmar Public Schools
Shafia Abdullahi, cultural liaison at Willmar Public Schools, stated: "She came here as a refugee. She does have legal status... It's not someone that came here illegally. It's not someone that smuggled their way here. They were someone that came here with legal papers."

Abdullahi added: "You're treating her like she's a felon, like she's a criminal, like she killed someone. Even murderers are innocent until proven guilty, and she's not even committed any crime, except be a Somalian."

## School Impact
- Approximately 90% of Somali students absent from Willmar schools on Tuesday
- Many Somali staff members stayed home to care for their children
- School district sent letters to staffers and students offering support and information about their rights

## Related Incident
During the Tuesday protest against ICE actions, agents deployed chemical irritant at the crowd, which included children. Emergency medical services was called to evaluate at least one child.

## Context: Operation PARRIS

This detention fits a documented pattern of ICE targeting refugees with pending green card applications under **Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening). According to the [Twin Cities Pioneer Press](https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/18/5600-green-card-applicants-in-minnesota-targeted-through-operation-parris/), approximately 5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota are being targeted through this operation.

The victim had legal refugee status (Form I-94) and her family had an active Green Card application pending - exactly the profile being targeted under this operation.

[Global Refuge](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) has documented that lawfully present refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."

(Note: This story seems to follow a pattern of Operation PARRIS (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) -- see [more details on this below](#operation-parris).)

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple local news sources (West Central Tribune, MinnPost), named school official providing statements, documented community response and school impact. Legal status claims come from school cultural liaison with knowledge of the family's situation.
