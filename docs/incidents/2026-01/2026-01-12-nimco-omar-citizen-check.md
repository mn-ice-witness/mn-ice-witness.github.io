# Citizen Check: U.S. Citizen Confronted by ICE Agents While Walking

## Summary
Nimco Omar, a U.S. citizen and Somali American, was surrounded by four masked federal agents who demanded her identification during what they called a "citizen check" while she was walking near 24 Somali Mall in Minneapolis. Omar refused to show ID, asserting her constitutional rights. After repeatedly asking "Where were you born?" and photographing her without permission, the agents eventually walked away.

## Official Accounts

Cited this incident as evidence of "unlawful racial profiling by DHS agents" in the state's lawsuit against DHS filed January 13, 2026.

## Witness Accounts

**Nimco Omar's account:**
> "I parked my car and began walking toward the 24 Somali Mall where suddenly four men who looked like soldiers suddenly jumped out of a car and surrounded me. They told me they needed to verify whether I was a citizen."

> "I don't need an ID to walk around in my city. This is my city."

> "I am a US citizen. I don't need to carry around an ID in my home. This is my home."

> "I'm a US citizen. I don't have to identify myself. I belong here—and it doesn't matter where I was born."

> "I was scared. I was devastated. I never imagined that something like this could happen to me in the United States."

## Legal Context
There is no federal law requiring U.S. citizens to carry proof of their citizenship. Immigration agents are barred from carrying out indiscriminate searches unless they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is in the country without authorization. No such thing as a "citizen check" exists in American law.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence filmed by the victim clearly documents the encounter. Multiple news outlets (FOX 9, Common Dreams, The Real News, Yahoo News) covered the incident with consistent details. The video was distributed via Storyful and cited by Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in the state's lawsuit against DHS. Omar's quotes and the agents' statements are directly captured in the footage.
