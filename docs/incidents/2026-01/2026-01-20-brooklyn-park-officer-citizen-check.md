# Off-Duty Brooklyn Park Police Officer Stopped at Gunpoint

## Summary
An off-duty Brooklyn Park police officer, described as a woman of color, was stopped by ICE agents who boxed in her vehicle, drew their weapons, and demanded paperwork to prove her citizenship. When she attempted to record the encounter on her phone, agents knocked the phone from her hands. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley disclosed the incident at a January 20 press conference, stating "If it's happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members fall victim daily."
