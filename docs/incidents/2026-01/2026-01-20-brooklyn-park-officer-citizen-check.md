# Metro Police Chiefs Call for End to Civil Rights Violations / Racially Discriminatory Citizen Checks; Off-Duty Brooklyn Park Police Officer Stopped at Gunpoint

## Summary
Three Twin Cities law enforcement leaders held a joint press conference at the Minnesota State Capitol on January 20 to address a pattern of ICE agents conducting racially discriminatory citizenship checks on people of color. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley disclosed that an off-duty Brooklyn Park police officer—a woman of color and U.S. citizen—was stopped by ICE agents who boxed in her vehicle, drew their weapons, and demanded paperwork to prove her citizenship. When she attempted to record the encounter, agents knocked the phone from her hands. "If it's happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members fall victim daily," Bruley said. Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt called the incidents "concrete examples of profiling," while St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry said "people are scared to death, afraid to go outside—not because their status is in question but because they know people get stopped based on appearance."

## Official Accounts

### Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley
On the off-duty officer incident:
"When they boxed her in, they demanded her paperwork, of which she's a U.S. Citizen and clearly would not have any paperwork. When she tried to record the incident, the phone was knocked out of her hands."

The officers had their guns drawn during this interaction. After the officer identified herself as a Brooklyn Park police officer, the agents "immediately left" without apology.

"If it's happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members fall victim daily."

On the broader pattern:
"Recently, as the last two weeks, we as law enforcement community have been receiving endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from US citizens. What we're hearing is they're being stopped in traffic stops or on the street with no cause and being forced to show paperwork to determine if they are here legally."

"Every one of these individuals is a person of color... it has to stop."

Bruley noted that accountability for federal agents' alleged abuses remains difficult because ICE officers cover their faces and do not display badges to identify themselves. He stated he believes the racial profiling is being carried out by a small subset of federal agents.

### Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt
"I am seeing and hearing about people in Hennepin County stopped, questioned and harassed solely because of the color of their skin."

Called the incidents "concrete examples of profiling."

### St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry
"People are scared to death, afraid to go outside—not because their status is in question but because they know people get stopped based on appearance."

### DHS/ICE Statement
In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security denied wrongdoing and called the allegations "disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE."

## Broader Context
The ACLU of Minnesota filed a class-action lawsuit against federal authorities alleging suspicionless stops and ethnic-based detention. DHS has deployed approximately 3,000 ICE and Border Patrol agents to Minnesota under "Operation Metro Surge," claiming 3,000 arrests over six weeks. This press conference represents the first time local law enforcement leaders have publicly spoken out against federal immigration agents' conduct in the Twin Cities.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - This incident and pattern of civil rights violations is documented through a formal press conference by three law enforcement officials: Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, and St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry. The press conference was covered by multiple major news outlets including KSTP, KARE 11, CBS Minnesota, Fox News, Washington Post, and Fox 9. While the specific officer's identity is protected, the account comes from her own police chief based on her direct report. The involvement of three separate law enforcement agencies lending credibility to citizen complaints establishes strong institutional corroboration of a pattern of racial profiling.
