# Metro Police Chiefs Call for End to Racially Discriminatory Citizen Checks / Civil Rights Violations; Off-Duty Officer Stopped at Gunpoint

## Summary
An off-duty Brooklyn Park police officer, described as a woman of color, was stopped by ICE agents who boxed in her vehicle, drew their weapons, and demanded paperwork to prove her citizenship. When she attempted to record the encounter on her phone, agents knocked the phone from her hands. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley disclosed the incident at a January 20 press conference alongside other Twin Cities law enforcement leaders, describing a pattern of ICE agents conducting citizenship checks on people of color without cause.

## Official Accounts

### Law Enforcement Press Conference (January 20, 2026)
Three Twin Cities law enforcement leaders held a joint press conference at the Minnesota State Capitol to address concerns about ICE conduct.

**Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley:**
"Recently, as the last two weeks, we as law enforcement community have been receiving endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from US citizens. What we're hearing is they're being stopped in traffic stops or on the street with no cause and being forced to show paperwork to determine if they are here legally."

"Every one of these individuals is a person of color... it has to stop."

"If it's happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members fall victim daily."

Bruley noted that accountability for federal agents' alleged abuses remains difficult because ICE officers cover their faces and do not display badges to identify themselves. He stated he believes the racial profiling is being carried out by a small subset of federal agents.

**Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt:**
Called the incidents "concrete examples of profiling."

**St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry:**
"People are scared to death, afraid to go outside—not because their status is in question but because they know people get stopped based on appearance."

### DHS/ICE Statement
No statement found addressing these specific allegations.

## Broader Context
The ACLU of Minnesota filed a class-action lawsuit against federal authorities alleging suspicionless stops and ethnic-based detention. DHS has deployed approximately 3,000 ICE and Border Patrol agents to Minnesota under "Operation Metro Surge," claiming 3,000 arrests over six weeks.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - This incident is documented through a formal press conference by multiple law enforcement officials including Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley, Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, and St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry. The press conference was covered by multiple major news outlets (KSTP, KARE 11, Raw Story, Alternet). While the specific officer's identity is protected, the account comes from her own police chief based on her direct report. The involvement of three separate law enforcement agencies lending credibility to citizen complaints establishes strong institutional corroboration.
