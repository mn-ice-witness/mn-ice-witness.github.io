# 15-Year-Old Girl Pepper Sprayed While Observing ICE Operation

## Summary
A 15-year-old girl was pepper sprayed by an ICE agent while observing an immigration enforcement operation at Skyline Gardens, a manufactured home community in Owatonna. Video shows the girl seated on the pavement, coughing, with orange blotches on her face consistent with pepper spray. Witnesses can be heard yelling "Why would you pepper spray a 15-year-old kid?" The girl had approached the scene with her mother to observe the operation. When asked if the incident report would document the pepper spray use on a minor, an agent replied: "We're not going to get into the details now."

## Official Accounts

### ICE Agent Response
When asked if the incident report would document the use of pepper spray on a minor, an agent replied: "We're not going to get into the details now."

One agent wearing a Nike sweatshirt began to explain: "As I was questioning the driver..." before being interrupted by whistles from observers.

## Context
The same evening, ICE conducted a workplace raid at Best Boy Farms (formerly Bushel Boy Farms) on 32nd Avenue NW in Owatonna, described as "the first such workplace operation to be recorded by observers." Five or six people were detained. A separate incident at Skyline Gardens shows ICE agents removing a woman from her vehicle and searching it. The mother and daughter reportedly approached this scene as observers before the girl was pepper sprayed.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Single Tier 1 local news source (Southern Minnesota News) with video evidence described in detail. Witnesses quoted. Agent behavior implicitly confirms pepper spray use. However, no corroborating major outlet coverage (Star Tribune, MPR, KARE 11), no affected individual identification, and video not directly accessible. Would upgrade to HIGH if corroborating coverage emerges or family comes forward.
