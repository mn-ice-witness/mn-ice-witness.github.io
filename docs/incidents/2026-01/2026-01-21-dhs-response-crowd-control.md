## Official Statement

Posted on X (@DHSgov):

> "Today, Border Patrol agents who were in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area as part of a targeted enforcement operation were repeatedly harassed and blocked by hostile crowds while simply trying to take bathroom breaks.
>
> At each gas station where the agents stopped to use the restroom, groups of agitators appeared, yelled at them, stalked them, and even tried to prevent law enforcement vehicles from leaving, creating unsafe conditions. At one stop, individuals in the crowd threw food at the agents. At their final gas station stop, someone spit on an agent. When an agent moved to detain the person who spit on him, the crowed tackled and attacked the agents while surrounding them.
>
> To safely clear the area agents had to use crowd control measures to disperse the hostile crowd."

## Context

This statement was posted after videos circulated showing Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino deploying hexachloroethane gas at Mueller Park near Ella Baker Global Studies & Humanities Magnet School during school dismissal, and agents pinning an observer to the ground and spraying chemical irritant directly into his face.

The incident occurred four days after U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez issued a preliminary injunction barring federal agents from using pepper spray on peaceful protesters and observers.

## Editorial Assessment

**HIGH** - Official DHS statement on @DHSgov. Video evidence from the same day shows gas deployed at a playground near a school during dismissal; see related incidents for details.
