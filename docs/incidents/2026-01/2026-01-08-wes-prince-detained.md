## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Wes Prince
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizen
- **Status:** Released same day, no charges filed

## Timeline
- **~8:00 AM** - Detained during protest at Bishop Henry Whipple Building
- **~5:00 PM** - Released after approximately 9 hours

## Witness Account (Wes Prince)
From his Facebook post and KSTP interview:

### Security Failures Observed
- Agents sharing badges to access cells ("one agent would pass off their badge access to another")
- Mugshots taken on personal cell phones with social media apps visible on home screen
- Notes written in notebooks, not on official forms
- Agents unable to locate detainees, asking other detainees where people were
- His cell phone was not found during jacket search (he kept it in breast pocket)

### Interrogation Concerns
- Agents asked for names of family members rather than "emergency contact"

### Conditions
- Observed ~40-50 migrants in large holding cell with "somber, defeated expressions"
- Cells marked with sticky notes ("USC" for U.S. citizens)
- Not fingerprinted; only cell phone photo taken

### His Assessment
> "The overall atmosphere is chaotic. I think it's a word that I keep coming to."

> "Because of course I was released - I'm an English-speaking white male (even though I had no ID on me to prove I was a US citizen). And there was fear, pain, exhaustion, and hopelessness on tear-stained faces - faces I will never see again."

## Official Response
DHS and ICE had not responded to KSTP's requests for comment at time of publication.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Firsthand account corroborated by on-record interview with local news (KSTP). Similar observations of chaos and disorganization reported by other detainees (Sigüenza and O'Keefe) detained 4 days later.
