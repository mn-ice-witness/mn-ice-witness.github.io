## What Happened
A video circulating on social media shows federal immigration officers putting a worker into a gray pickup truck in a parking lot behind General Mills' Chanhassen manufacturing facility.

The 27-second clip with no audio demonstrates Immigration and Customs Enforcement's growing presence at Minnesota's workplaces, including those of Minnesota's Fortune 500 companies.

## Official Accounts

### General Mills Statement
A General Mills spokesperson confirmed the company is aware of the situation involving a contractor:
> "Our team requested ICE agent identification, followed all our safety protocols and partnered with local law enforcement."

### DHS Statement
DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin stated ICE officers "pulled over and arrested an individual in the General Mills parking lot" who "unlawfully entered" the U.S. in 2023. DHS did not answer whether officers had warned the company they were pursuing the individual.

## Context
This arrest is part of a broader pattern of ICE operations affecting Minnesota's largest employers during Operation Metro Surge. From Target to General Mills and Caribou Coffee, Minnesota's biggest companies are feeling pressure amid the surge of immigration officers in the state.

Businesses of all sizes are grappling with difficult and sensitive situations, dealing with detained employees, enacting safety measures for workers, and navigating public communications.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM-HIGH** - Confirmed by General Mills spokesperson and DHS statement. Video exists but exact date unclear ("second week of January"). Limited details about the detained individual.
