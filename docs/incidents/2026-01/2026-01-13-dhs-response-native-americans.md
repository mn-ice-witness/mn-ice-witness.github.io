# DHS Response: Native American Detentions

## Summary
After four Oglala Sioux Tribe members (U.S. citizens) were detained near Little Earth, DHS refused to provide information unless the tribe entered into an ICE cooperation agreement. The tribe declined, citing treaty violations. ICE and DHS did not respond to media requests for comment.

## Official Response (or Lack Thereof)

### DHS Refusal to Comment
When the Oglala Sioux Tribe demanded information about their detained tribal members, federal officials told the tribe they would only release information if the tribe entered into an agreement with ICE.

**ICE and DHS did not respond to Axios for comment regarding the detained tribal members.**

### Tribe's Response to DHS
The Oglala Sioux Tribe declined the agreement, stating it would "violate its treaties with the U.S. government."

The tribe's memorandum stated:
> "Tribal citizens are not aliens" and are "categorically outside immigration jurisdiction."

### State Officials' Response

**Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan** (Native American):
> "Native people have been here since time immemorial – there's no one that has been a citizen of this country longer than us. The obvious racial profiling happening to our community is disgraceful."

**Minnesota Native American Caucus:**
> "Native peoples are Indigenous to this country, existing on this continent for thousands of years before the colonization of this nation — rendering deportation impossible and absurd."

## Unanswered Questions

The following questions remain unaddressed in DHS communications:
- Why U.S. citizens were detained for 12+ hours
- Why detained individuals' names were not recorded
- How homeless citizens without documentation should prove citizenship
- Whether racial profiling protocols were followed

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - DHS's non-response is itself well-documented. The demand for a cooperation agreement in exchange for information about detained citizens is documented by multiple sources.
