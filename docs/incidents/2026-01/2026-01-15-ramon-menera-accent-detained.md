# U.S. Citizen Detained Because of "Accent"

## Summary
Ramon Menera, a U.S. citizen, was detained by Border Patrol agents outside his home in a Minneapolis suburb in front of his 5-year-old daughter. The agent accused him of not being a U.S. citizen "because of your accent." Menera was eventually released but described the traumatic impact on his daughter, who asked him afterward: "Are you okay? They were going to take you? I don't want to lose you."

## Witness Accounts

### Ramon Menera
In an interview with CNN, Menera described his daughter's reaction: "She was shaken when I got in the home. And she's like, 'Are you okay? They were going to take you? I don't want to lose you.'"

Menera says that ICE doesn't care if you're a citizen or not, and feels he is a target because of his strong accent and appearance.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
CNN reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on the incident. No response documented.

## Legal Context
This incident is cited in the ACLU's class-action lawsuit filed January 15, 2026, alleging widespread racial profiling, warrantless stops, and unconstitutional arrests by federal immigration agents. The ACLU argues that arrests based solely on ethnic appearance or accent violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence from multiple sources (CNN, TikTok, Threads). Direct victim interview with CNN. Part of documented pattern of citizenship checks based on appearance/accent during Operation Metro Surge.
