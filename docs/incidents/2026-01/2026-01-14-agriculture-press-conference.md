### Economic Impact
- Minnesota agriculture generates $105 billion annually and supports over 380,000 jobs statewide

- Labor shortages expected to drive higher food prices

### ICE Activity in Rural Minnesota
Sen. Kupec stated ICE activity is occurring well beyond the Twin Cities: "We have ICE agents who are roaming around the countryside causing disruptions through the ag industry."

### Detentions of Legal Workers
Kupec reported: "We have seen numerous instances of legal people being picked up, detained, shipped off."

### Worker Fear
Farmers Union President Wertish described H-2A workers afraid to report to work: "They're legal. Can you imagine any one of you, of us, being afraid to go out of our house?"

Wertish also said farmers are afraid to make food deliveries in Minneapolis.

Deputy Commissioner Vaubel noted: "We're talking grocery stores, food processing facilities, meat processors, dairy farms. The food supply will be significantly affected."

## Official Statements

### Sen. Aric Putnam
"We are in a moment of profound crisis... because of decisions made by the federal government."

"This is about fear. Real cops don't wear masks." He said ICE activity is occurring without coordination with local law enforcement.

"Legislatively, we have no jurisdiction to handle these concerns. But unlike Kristi Noem, we're in our communities, and we know what's going on in them."

### Sen. Rob Kupec
"We have seen numerous instances of legal people being picked up, detained, shipped off."

"We have ICE agents who are roaming around the countryside causing disruptions through the ag industry."

### Gary Wertish
Warned that impacts will worsen as planting season approaches. Said farmworkers are afraid to stop for lunch during workdays.

### Andrea Vaubel
"Immigrants are a critical part of this labor force."

## Specific Incidents Mentioned

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple independent news sources (Pioneer Press, InForum, Civil Eats, KVRR, Agweek, Bring Me The News), video of full press conference available, named elected officials and agriculture leaders speaking on record. Claims about economic impact and H-2A visa numbers are verifiable. Pattern consistent with documented incidents across Greater Minnesota.
