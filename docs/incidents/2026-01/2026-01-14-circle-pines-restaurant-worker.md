# Restaurant Worker with Legal Visa Detained by Plain-Clothed Agents

## Summary
A restaurant worker at Pancho's Taqueria and Mexican Cafe in Circle Pines with a valid legal work visa was detained by two plain-clothed federal agents lying in wait outside the business around 5 p.m. Surveillance video shows the worker shouting "Ayuda!" (Help!) as agents pulled him from a storage area. The worker, known as Kevin, has no criminal record and fled to the U.S. under asylum protections after a cartel took over his family's factory in his home country. He was transported to the Whipple Federal Building and then to El Paso, Texas within 12 hours. A GoFundMe raised nearly $25,000 for legal fees and family support.

## What Happened
Surveillance video from Pancho's Taqueria shows two plainclothes federal officers pulling the employee out of a back storage unit around 5 p.m. Co-workers had been watching the men in the rear lot for about 20 minutes before the detention unfolded. The footage shows a brief struggle in which Kevin loses his phone, glasses and hat before being taken into custody while repeatedly shouting "Ayuda" for help.

## Current Status
Kevin was transported to the Whipple Federal Building within hours of his arrest and transferred to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas within roughly 12 hours. The restaurant owner attempted twice to bring him his glasses but found he had already been transferred.

The restaurant closed on January 18-19 in response to the incident and the broader ICE climate.

## Employer Response
Restaurant owners Frank and Stacey Chase confirmed:
- Employee has a valid work visa/work permit
- Employee has no criminal record in the U.S. or his native country
- Employee came to the U.S. under asylum protections
- Restaurant organized GoFundMe for legal fees

From the GoFundMe: "He was moved from the federal Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis to a detention facility in El Paso, Texas within 12 hours of his arrest. Twice, in those first hours, we attempted to bring him his glasses so that he can see, only to realize he had immediately been transported."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Video evidence of detention, restaurant owner confirmed legal status and lack of criminal record, multiple news reports, community fundraising response.
