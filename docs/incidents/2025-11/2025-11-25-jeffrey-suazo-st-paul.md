# House Painter Arrested After 5-Hour Standoff; Family Reports Humiliation, No Warrant Shown

## Summary
Jeffrey Suazo, a 26-year-old house painter from Honduras, was arrested after a 5-hour standoff with ICE agents on St. Paul's East Side. Federal agents pursuing a different man (Victor Rodriguez) followed Suazo when he fled upon seeing federal activity. Family members report agents entered without showing a warrant and taunted/humiliated them during the standoff. Over 200 protesters gathered, leading to deployment of pepper spray and nonlethal munitions.

2. Star Tribune (Nov 26, 2025): [Questions, conflicting accounts emerge after St. Paul ICE arrest, protests](https://www.startribune.com/conflicting-accounts-emerge-after-st-paul-ice-raid/601533942)

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Jeffrey Suazo
- **Age:** 26
- **Origin:** Honduras
- **Citizenship:** Undocumented (fled persecution in Honduras)
- **Occupation:** House painter
- **Time in U.S.:** 4 years
- **Family describes him as:** "Hardworking and humble"

## Family Members Affected
- **Deylin:** Girlfriend
- **Siamy (6):** Deylin's sister, present during raid
- **Maria:** Deylin's mother
- **Daniela:** Suazo's pregnant sister-in-law

## Timeline
1. **Morning** - Suazo leaves home simultaneously with Victor Rodriguez (first-floor tenant from Honduras)
2. **ICE pursuit** - Agents following Rodriguez also target Suazo
3. **Suazo flees** - Drives back home after agents surround his vehicle
4. **Collision** - Allegedly strikes agent's vehicle during pursuit
5. **Standoff begins** - Agents surround home; Suazo takes refuge inside
6. **5 hours** - Standoff continues with family inside
7. **200+ protesters** - Crowd gathers; confrontations with agents and St. Paul police
8. **Pepper spray deployed** - At least one photojournalist hospitalized
9. **Surrender** - Suazo turns himself in after consulting legal advisors

## What Family Reported
- Agents entered the house **without presenting a warrant**
- Family members were **taunted and humiliated** during the 5-hour standoff
- Agents made **threats and used manipulation tactics**
- 6-year-old Siamy was present during the raid

## Charges
Suazo was charged federally with **assaulting a federal officer** (related to allegedly striking agent's vehicle during pursuit).

## DHS Account
DHS identified the individual as "Victor Molina Rodriguez," described as a Honduran national previously removed from the U.S. who allegedly re-entered illegally. DHS stated he had prior domestic abuse and disorderly conduct offenses.

**Note:** DHS appears to have conflated Jeffrey Suazo with Victor Rodriguez, who was the original target.

## Community Response
- Over 200 protesters gathered at the scene
- Confrontations with federal agents and St. Paul police
- Pepper spray and nonlethal munitions deployed
- At least one photojournalist was hospitalized

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Detailed reporting from Sahan Journal with family interviews and named sources. Star Tribune also covered the incident. Video evidence exists. The discrepancy between family's account (Jeffrey Suazo, house painter) and DHS's account (Victor Molina Rodriguez) suggests possible case of mistaken identity or conflation of two individuals. Family's allegations of no warrant and humiliation are documented.
