## Summary
Federal agents raided Bro-Tex Inc., a cleaning products manufacturer in St. Paul, detaining 14 workers in what organizers called the largest ICE workplace raid in Minnesota in 2025.

## Victim(s)
- **Number detained:** 14 workers
- **Company:** Bro-Tex Inc. (makes and distributes wipes, towels and other absorbent cleaning products)
- **Immigration status:** Detained for immigration violations

## What Happened
Federal agents from ICE, FBI, and Homeland Security Investigations raided the Bro-Tex facility at 830 N. Hampden Ave. Workers were detained inside the facility.

As agents attempted to leave, protesters linked arms to block their vehicles. Agents responded by:
- Shooting chemical irritants into the crowd
- Pepper spraying protesters directly in the face

## Scale
Ryan Perez, organizing director of Communities Organizing Latine Power and Action (COPAL), said this was "the largest ICE workplace raid" he knows of in Minnesota in 2025.

## Official Statements

### ICE Statement
ICE said they "conducted court authorized law enforcement activity and served a search warrant in furtherance of a federal criminal investigation."

### Governor Tim Walz
"Working to understand what unfolded. We received no heads up from federal authorities on this operation."

### Mayor-elect Kaohly Her
"Flooding our neighborhoods with ICE and other federal agents only heightens tensions on the ground, rather than calming it. We need clear, timely information from our federal agencies so that the panic doesn't take over and rumors don't spread."

## Community Response
- About 100 neighbors, immigrant advocates, and elected officials gathered the next day for a vigil outside the facility
- Multiple violent clashes between protesters and agents documented
- Protesters demanded answers about the raid

## Context
This raid occurred approximately one month before "Operation Metro Surge" was announced, and demonstrated the scale of workplace enforcement that would intensify in December 2025.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple local news sources including MPR News, Sahan Journal, Pioneer Press, and Minnesota Reformer. 14 confirmed detentions. Governor and Mayor-elect statements on record. Documentation of pepper spray use on protesters.
