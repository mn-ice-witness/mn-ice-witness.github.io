## What Happened
ICE officers arrived at Nupa's Civic Center Drive location on the morning of February 12, 2025. They detained two brothers in the parking lot as the workers arrived for their kitchen shifts.

According to the restaurant's Facebook post, the men may have been working under false documentation, but the owner noted that "ICE did not ask for any documentation before making the arrest."

## Impact on Business
- Restaurant was forced to close its Civic Center Drive location starting February 13
- Owner cited critical staffing shortage: "We haven't had any new applicants in 4 years"
- Both locations later reopened after adjusting operations

## Official Statements

### Rochester Police Department
RPD confirmed they were aware of ICE agents' presence in Rochester but stated they were not involved in the operation and did not assist federal agents in any way.

### Restaurant Statement
"As far as we know, they had no criminal record... It's the first time we've experienced anything like this."

## Community Response
The arrests raised alarm among immigrant rights groups in Minnesota, confirming concerns that long-time immigrants with no criminal records who simply seek a better life would be targeted under stricter immigration enforcement policies.

## Context
This raid occurred before "Operation Metro Surge" and represents early enforcement targeting workplaces in Greater Minnesota. It demonstrated the vulnerability of small businesses relying on immigrant labor.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple local news sources (Post Bulletin, KTTC, Star Tribune, Bring Me The News). Restaurant confirmed details on social media. Clear documentation of impact on local business. Represents pattern of targeting workers without criminal records.
