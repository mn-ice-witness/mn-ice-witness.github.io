# Addiction Recovery Leader Detained, Labeled "Gang Member"

## Summary
Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi, 47, a Somali refugee who works as an addiction recovery leader helping others find sobriety, was detained during Operation Metro Surge. ICE labeled him a "gang member" despite the fact that he won his freedom in 2018 after a judge noted he had "worked to turn his life around" since 2007.

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi
- **Age:** 47
- **Arrival:** Came to U.S. in 1996 as Somali refugee fleeing civil war
- **Occupation:** Works at homeless shelter helping Indigenous population; formerly worked at Park Avenue Center substance abuse facility
- **Recovery:** Sober for 13 years, leadership position in Alcoholics Anonymous

## Background
After arriving as a refugee, Abdi became involved with gangs and committed felonies including fraud, receiving stolen property, and vehicle theft. However, around 2007 he began turning his life around.

## 2018 Case
In 2018, during Trump's first term, Abdi was targeted for deportation. A U.S. Magistrate noted:
- He had "worked to turn his life around" since about 2007
- "He has worked with law enforcement and the community to discourage young Somali-Americans from associating with gangs and extremist groups"
- He had "joined Alcoholics Anonymous and was recently elected to a leadership position"
- Since 2014, worked at substance abuse treatment facility

In February 2019, Judge Sarah B. Mazzie released him on his own recognizance after community rallied to save him.

## ICE's Characterization
DHS described Abdi as "a former member of the Gangster Disciples and is a known current member of Vice Lord Nation" with multiple felony convictions.

## Wife's Response
Christenson pushed back, saying Abdi is NOT a current gang member and had turned his life around after getting sober 13 years ago.

## Current Status
Initially processed at Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling. Transferred to detention facility in Nebraska.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Multiple news sources confirm detention and background. The characterization of his current gang involvement is disputed. His past criminal record is documented, but his rehabilitation is also documented by court records from 2018-2019.
