# DHS Response: Abdulkadir Abdi "Gang Member"

## Summary
In the first Operation Metro Surge press release, DHS labeled Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi as a current gang member. This characterization differs from a 2018 federal court finding that he had "turned his life around" and his family's statements that he is not currently in a gang.

## Official Statement

### DHS Press Release (December 4, 2025)
DHS listed Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi first among 12 individuals arrested during Operation Metro Surge, describing him as:

> "A former member of the Gangster Disciples and is a known current member of Vice Lord Nation" with convictions for fraud, receiving stolen property, and vehicle theft.

### Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin
> "Sanctuary policies and politicians like Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey allowed these pedophiles, domestic terrorists, and gang members to roam the streets."

> "ICE law enforcement are risking their lives to protect Minnesotans."

## Fact Check

### Claim: Abdi is a "known current member" of Vice Lord Nation

**Court Record (2018):** U.S. Magistrate Sarah B. Mazzie found that Abdi had "worked to turn his life around" since about 2007 and "has worked with law enforcement and the community to discourage young Somali-Americans from associating with gangs and extremist groups."

**Family Response:** His wife Christenson stated Abdi is NOT a current gang member and had turned his life around after getting sober 13 years ago.

**Work History:** Since 2014, Abdi worked at Park Avenue Center substance abuse facility. At time of arrest, he worked at a homeless shelter helping the Indigenous population and held a leadership position in Alcoholics Anonymous.

### Additional Context from Other Sources

- Abdi came to the U.S. in 1996 as a Somali refugee fleeing civil war
- His criminal activity was in the past; he began rehabilitation around 2007
- A federal judge released him on his own recognizance in 2019 after the community rallied
- He has been sober for 13 years and helps others with addiction recovery

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Official DHS press release. The "current gang member" characterization differs from 2018 court findings and documented rehabilitation. Past criminal record is acknowledged, but the timeline of his rehabilitation is a matter of public record.
