## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Joseph Boman
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizen
- **Role:** Activist/observer monitoring ICE operations

## Timeline
1. **Minnoco gas station** - Federal agents photograph Boman at Penn Avenue and West 68th Street
2. **Following** - Black Nissan trails Boman as he leaves
3. **Whipple area** - Boman observed ICE operations near Whipple Federal Building
4. **Arrest** - Hennepin County Sheriff's deputies arrest Boman in private parking lot across from Whipple

## Significance
This incident demonstrates:
- Federal agents photographing and tracking observers
- Coordination between federal agents and local sheriff's deputies
- Targeting of U.S. citizen activists exercising First Amendment rights

## Context
The incident occurred during "Operation Metro Surge" when federal agents appeared to be using tactics to sidestep a Minneapolis ordinance that restricts city police from cooperating with ICE. By coordinating with Hennepin County Sheriff instead, agents circumvented the city's restrictions.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Single source (Unicorn Riot) with photos showing surveillance. Named U.S. citizen affected individual. Demonstrates pattern of targeting observers and coordination with county law enforcement to avoid city restrictions.
