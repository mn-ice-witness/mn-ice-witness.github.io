# Man With Legal Protection Status Detained at Restaurant; Vehicle Abandoned

## Summary
Jose, a Salvadoran immigrant with legal withholding-of-removal protection status (a form of legal protection meant to prevent deportation), was detained by federal agents during lunch at Lomabonita restaurant on St. Paul's East Side. Agents abandoned his vehicle with construction tools on Margaret Street and White Bear Avenue.

## Affected Individual(s)
- **Name:** Jose (last name withheld for safety)
- **Origin:** El Salvador
- **Legal Status:** Withholding of removal protection (legal status meant to bar deportation)
- **Occupation:** Construction worker
- **Background:** Former cop who turned down offers to work with gangs inside El Salvador's corrupt police force

## What Happened
Federal agents detained Jose during his lunch break at Lomabonita restaurant on St. Paul's East Side. After his detention, agents abandoned his vehicle - which contained his construction tools - at Margaret Street and White Bear Avenue.

## Legal Status Concern
Jose had "withholding of removal" protection, a legal status that is supposed to prevent deportation. His detention despite this protection raises significant legal questions about whether ICE is detaining people with valid legal status.

## Vehicle Abandonment
The abandonment of Jose's vehicle with his construction tools inside is part of a pattern documented by Unicorn Riot, where ICE agents leave detainees' vehicles without calling responders or making arrangements for the property.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Single source (Unicorn Riot) but detailed account. The legal status claim (withholding of removal) is significant and verifiable through court records. Demonstrates pattern of detaining people with legal protections.
