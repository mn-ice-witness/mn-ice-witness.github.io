# U.S. Citizen Questioned for Speaking Somali While Shoveling Snow with Mother

## Summary
Mahamed Eydarus, a 25-year-old U.S. citizen of Somali descent from Fridley, was detained by masked ICE agents on the morning of December 10, 2025, while shoveling snow with his mother after finishing an overnight shift as a personal care assistant. Agents surrounded him in unmarked vehicles, asked why he and his mother were speaking a "foreign language," demanded his mother remove her niqab (religious face covering), and separated him from his mother before eventually releasing them. Eydarus is now a plaintiff in the ACLU class-action lawsuit against ICE.

## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Mahamed Eydarus
- **Age:** 25
- **Residence:** Fridley, MN
- **Occupation:** Personal care assistant (had just finished overnight shift)
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizen
- **Ethnicity:** Somali descent
- **Mother:** Also U.S. citizen, also detained briefly

## Timeline
- **Morning, December 10, 2025** - Eydarus finishes overnight shift as personal care assistant
- **Shortly after** - Eydarus and mother begin shoveling snow from his parking space
- **During shoveling** - Masked agents in unmarked vehicles surround him
- **Detention begins** - Agents ask why they are speaking a "foreign language"
- **Religious violation** - Agents demand mother remove her niqab (religious face covering)
- **Separation** - Eydarus separated from his mother
- **Lengthy detention** - Both held "for a lengthy period"
- **Release** - Both released after showing identification

## What Happened
According to the ACLU lawsuit filed January 15, 2026:

1. Eydarus was shoveling snow with his mother when masked federal agents pulled up in unmarked vehicles
2. When he looked up from shoveling, agents had already surrounded him
3. They approached and asked him to present identification
4. Agents refused to identify themselves
5. Agents asked why Eydarus and his mother were speaking a "foreign language"
6. Agents ordered his mother to remove her niqab (a religious and cultural face covering)
7. Agents separated Eydarus from his mother
8. Both were detained "for a lengthy period" before being released after showing ID

## Constitutional Violations Alleged
- **Fourth Amendment:** Unreasonable seizure without probable cause
- **First Amendment:** Religious expression (demanding removal of niqab)
- **Equal Protection:** Racial profiling based on ethnicity and language

## Impact on Victim
Per the lawsuit: "Mr. Eydarus is scared to go about his daily life in public, as he fears being again detained based on his Somali descent and appearance."

## Official Accounts

### DHS Response
A DHS spokesperson called the allegations "disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE," stating: "What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity."

## Legal Action
Eydarus is one of three plaintiffs in ACLU of Minnesota's class-action lawsuit filed January 15, 2026:
- **Case:** Filed in federal court
- **Defendants:** DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons
- **Relief sought:** Statewide injunction against racial profiling practices

## Context
This incident occurred on the same day as the Mubashir Khalif Hussen wrongful detention in Cedar-Riverside. Both cases involve U.S. citizens of Somali descent being detained despite repeatedly asserting their citizenship, demonstrating a pattern of racial profiling.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Named plaintiff in federal lawsuit with detailed sworn allegations. Multiple national and local news sources (NBC News, Star Tribune, Sahan Journal). Part of documented pattern of Somali-Americans being racially profiled. Corroborates other incidents from same day.
