# U.S. Citizen Tackled, Detained by ICE During Lunch Break

## Summary
Mubashir, a 20-year-old U.S. citizen and Somali American, was tackled, placed in a chokehold, and detained by ICE agents for several hours while on his lunch break in Minneapolis' Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. Despite repeatedly asserting his citizenship and offering to show his passport, agents refused to verify his status until hours later at a federal facility. After his citizenship was confirmed, agents refused to drive him back, forcing him to walk in the snow.

## Official Accounts

### DHS/ICE Statement
DHS released statement on Friday, December 13, denying racial profiling allegations:

> "On December 9th, ICE officers were investigating criminal immigration violations in Minneapolis near a location that has a high level of criminal activity. The officers were having a consensual conversation with a suspected illegal alien. At that time, a second male individual walked out of a nearby restaurant, turned around, and fled from law enforcement. Having reasonable suspicion--as protected under the U.S. Constitution--officers gave chase and caught up with the individual, who violently resisted officers and refused to answer questions."

DHS called racial profiling allegations "disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE."

### Local Officials

**Mayor Jacob Frey:**
> "Taken into custody for no reason at all, in clear violation of law and the Constitution of the United States for simply walking down the street and looking like he's Somali."

**Police Chief Brian O'Hara:**
> "I apologize that this happened to you in my city, with people wearing vests that say 'police.' That's embarrassing."

O'Hara added that city leaders don't object to lawful arrests but hope arrests can be well-planned for safety. He pointed to ICE agents using "at the very least, questionable methods."

**Governor Tim Walz:**
Sent letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem demanding review of the arrests:
> "The forcefulness, lack of communication, and unlawful practices displayed by your agents will not be tolerated in Minnesota."

## Witness Accounts

**Mubashir's account:**
> "The agent then, at one point, he never identified himself, he didn't say 'ICE stop.' I feel like I was getting assaulted, I was getting kidnapped, and that's exactly what it was."

> "I told him, 'I'm a U.S. citizen, what is going on?' He didn't seem to care."

> "All I did was step outside as a Somali American, and I just got chased by a masked person... They dragged me across the road. They slammed me to the ground, choked me. That was uncalled for."

> "I just felt targeted. That shouldn't happen to anyone, that's not right. I deserve to be here like anyone else -- I'm a U.S. citizen."

On being denied a ride back:
> "I asked three times, they said, 'No, you're walking.'"

Mubashir stated he was also denied water and medical assistance during detention.

**Community witnesses:**
- Video showed officers using a chokehold and forcing Mubashir to his knees in the snow
- Community members blew whistles during the arrest
- Witnesses chased the ICE vehicle in traffic; one stood in front of it
- Person brought copy of Mubashir's passport to the scene

## Related Incidents
At least two other Somali U.S. citizens were arrested by ICE and released the same day, according to CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein.

**Jaylani Hussein statement:**
> "We believe this is a violation of our constitution."

## Context
This incident occurred during "Operation Metro Surge," an ICE enforcement operation targeting the Twin Cities that began in December 2025. By December 10, over 400 arrests had been made across Minnesota. The operation specifically targeted Somali immigrant communities. 70% of those arrested lacked criminal convictions, according to CATO Institute analysis.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Extensively documented incident with video evidence, press conference featuring the affected individual, statements from multiple city and state officials, and coverage from over a dozen major news outlets. Core facts are consistent across all sources. DHS's "reasonable suspicion" defense is disputed by affected individual's account and local officials. The discrepancy over whether Mubashir "fled" or "simply turned around" is the primary point of contention.
