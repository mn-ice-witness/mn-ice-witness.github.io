## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Adnan Hisri
- **Age:** 20
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizen (born in United States)
- **Relationship:** Son of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)

## What Happened
According to Rep. Omar, her son was stopped by ICE agents on Saturday, December 13, 2025, after leaving a Target store. He was asked to prove his citizenship. After producing his passport, he was released.

## Rep. Omar's Statements
- "Yesterday after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by ICE agents and once he was able to produce his passport ID they did let him go."
- "I had to remind him just how worried I am because all of these areas they're talking about are areas where he can possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling."
- "They are looking for young men who look Somali, that they think are undocumented."
- Omar noted her son "always carries" his passport over fears of ICE encounters
- Omar said her son has had previous encounters with federal agents, including at a Twin Cities mosque where agents entered while he and others were praying

## DHS Response
- "ICE has absolutely ZERO record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son"
- Accused Omar of making "unsupported accusations"
- Called claims of racial profiling "disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE"
- Said ICE enforcement actions are based on "reasonable suspicion" under the Fourth Amendment

## Rep. Omar's Office Response
"The congresswoman's son and others were pulled over by ICE, racially profiled, and forced to prove their citizenship with a passport. ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight."

## Significance
This incident highlights concerns about:
- Racial profiling of Somali-Americans and other people of color
- U.S. citizens being forced to carry passports to prove citizenship
- Disputed record-keeping by federal agencies
- Minnesota being home to the largest Somali community in the U.S.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM-HIGH** - Multiple national news sources. Named U.S. citizen victim. Rep. Omar's account is disputed by DHS, but her son's previous encounters with ICE (including at a mosque) add credibility. The pattern of U.S. citizens being stopped and asked for proof of citizenship is consistent with other documented incidents.
