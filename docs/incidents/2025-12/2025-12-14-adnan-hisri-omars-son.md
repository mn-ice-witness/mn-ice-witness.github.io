## Victim(s)
- **Name:** Adnan Hisri
- **Age:** 20
- **Citizenship:** U.S. Citizen (born in United States)
- **Relationship:** Son of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)

## What Happened
According to Rep. Omar, her son was stopped by ICE agents on Saturday, December 13, 2025, after leaving a Target store. He was asked to prove his citizenship. After producing his passport, he was released.

## Rep. Omar's Statements
- "Yesterday after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by ICE agents and once he was able to produce his passport ID they did let him go."
- "I had to remind him just how worried I am because all of these areas they're talking about are areas where he can possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling."
- "They are looking for young men who look Somali, that they think are undocumented."
- Omar noted her son "always carries" his passport over fears of ICE encounters
- Omar said her son has had previous encounters with federal agents, including at a Twin Cities mosque where agents entered while he and others were praying

## DHS Response
- "ICE has absolutely ZERO record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son"
- Accused Omar of making "unsupported accusations"
- Called claims of racial profiling "disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE"
- Said ICE enforcement actions are based on "reasonable suspicion" under the Fourth Amendment

## Rep. Omar's Office Response
"The congresswoman's son and others were pulled over by ICE, racially profiled, and forced to prove their citizenship with a passport. ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight."

## Significance
This incident highlights concerns about:
- Racial profiling of Somali-Americans and other people of color
- U.S. citizens being forced to carry passports to prove citizenship
- Disputed record-keeping by federal agencies
- Minnesota being home to the largest Somali community in the U.S.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - While well reported by multiple national news sources, there were no other firsthand witnesses present on scene to corroborate the account. The incident relies solely on Rep. Omar's statement about her son's experience. DHS disputes the incident occurred and claims "zero record" of the stop. Named U.S. citizen victim and the pattern of U.S. citizens being stopped is consistent with other documented incidents, but the lack of independent witnesses or corroborating evidence warrants medium rather than higher trustworthiness.
