### Abdisalan Abdi (Money Transfer Business Owner)
Watched the pregnant woman as she sat down to prevent herself from falling or slipping. Officers grabbed her by the arms and dragged her through the snow.

## Official Response
Hennepin County Sheriff's Office responded after ICE agents called for help after being surrounded by protesters.

## Community Impact
Karmel Mall, usually a bustling hub for Minneapolis' Somali community, fell silent after ICE raids. Signs on the mall's doors declared: "No ICE enter without court order."

Business owner Khadijo Warsawe: "I could almost count how many sales I made in the past three weeks, because the mall is empty."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple news sources (Fox 9, CBS, Minnesota Reformer) with named witnesses. Significant community impact documented. Part of broader pattern of ICE targeting Somali neighborhoods.
