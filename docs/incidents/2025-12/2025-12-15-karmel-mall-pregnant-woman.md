## Witness Accounts

### Abdisalan Abdi (Money Transfer Business Owner)
Watched the pregnant woman as she sat down to prevent herself from falling or slipping. Officers grabbed her by the arms and dragged her through the snow.

### Tonika Deutch (Observer)
> "We kept yelling, 'She is pregnant, she's pregnant.' They put their knees on her. We kept telling them, 'She can't breathe, let her up...'"

Deutch, who said she was present throughout the encounter, stated the woman had been protesting the ICE operation with activists when agents confronted her. "They chased her down and then they threw her down at the end of the block."

## Official Response

### Hennepin County Sheriff's Office
Responded after ICE agents called for help after being surrounded by protesters.

### DHS (Tricia McLaughlin, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs)
Disputed witness accounts, stating the woman "rushed an ICE vehicle and attempted to vandalize it." Claimed agents tried to apprehend her but did not ultimately detain her. "When ICE officers apprehended her for vandalizing a government vehicle, they were swarmed and attacked by rioters, who punched, kicked, and threw rocks at officers. Officers abandoned their attempt to arrest the vandal for their own safety." Added that the crowd "later claimed" the woman was pregnant.

### Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara
Said at a news conference that local police were called to the scene by a federal agent who claimed officers needed help. But when police arrived, there was no violence against federal officers, O'Hara said, adding that other law enforcement agencies may have been using "questionable methods."

## Affected Individual Status
A close friend of the woman told a witness that she was released from ICE custody a few hours later on Monday. Per the Star Tribune, the woman is Mexican and a legal resident. Her pregnancy could not be independently confirmed.

## Community Impact
Karmel Mall, usually a bustling hub for Minneapolis' Somali community, fell silent after ICE raids. Signs on the mall's doors declared: "No ICE enter without court order."

Business owner Khadijo Warsawe: "I could almost count how many sales I made in the past three weeks, because the mall is empty."

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Seven independent sources including local (Fox 9, CBS, Star Tribune, Minnesota Reformer) and national (TMZ, Fox News, Inquisitr). Multiple video recordings exist. Named witnesses (Tonika Deutch, Abdisalan Abdi). Minneapolis Police Chief publicly questioned federal agents' methods. DHS disputed account but Star Tribune confirmed woman was Mexican legal resident who was released same day.
