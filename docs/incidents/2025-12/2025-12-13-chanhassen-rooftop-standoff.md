# Construction Workers Take Refuge on Roof During Hours-Long ICE Standoff

## Summary
Two construction workers, Edgar and Marco Chicaiza Dutan, took refuge on a roof at a Chanhassen construction site as ICE agents surrounded them. The standoff lasted several hours in cold weather. State Rep. Alex Falconer reported that agents lacked a judicial warrant and "didn't know who they were trying to find." Community members were denied permission to provide blankets or assistance.

## Victim(s)
- **Names:** Edgar and Marco Chicaiza Dutan
- **Occupation:** Construction workers
- **Status:** Detained after standoff

## What Happened
ICE agents surrounded a construction site where the two workers were working on a roof. Rather than come down, the workers remained on the roof while agents waited below.

The standoff lasted several hours in cold December weather. Community members who arrived to support the workers were denied permission to provide blankets or other assistance.

## State Representative Statement

### Rep. Alex Falconer
"They didn't have a judicial warrant, they didn't know who they were trying to find."

## Conditions
- Cold weather standoff lasting several hours
- Workers exposed on rooftop
- Community members prevented from providing blankets/assistance
- No judicial warrant presented by agents

## Related Incident
This standoff followed the Eden Prairie detention of Gomez on December 11, 2025, where his 13-year-old son was handcuffed.

## Editorial Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Local news coverage with state representative on record confirming no judicial warrant. The denial of humanitarian assistance (blankets in cold weather) and lack of warrant are significant civil rights concerns.
