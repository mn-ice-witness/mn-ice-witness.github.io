# Hola Arepa Staff Refuses ICE Entry Without Warrant

## Summary
Two plain-clothed ICE agents entered Hola Arepa restaurant during dinner service, claiming to search for someone. When general manager Naomi Rathke demanded to see a judicial warrant, the agents said "We don't need a warrant." Rathke refused entry to the kitchen and the agents eventually left without detaining anyone. The restaurant closed early and safely escorted employees to their cars.

## Owner's Account

### Christina Nguyen (Owner)
The agents said they were searching for a woman whose photo they showed on a phone. "It wasn't anybody who works for us at all."

### Naomi Rathke (General Manager)
Refused access to the kitchen since they were unable to present a signed judicial warrant. Under law, ICE must have a warrant signed by a judge with the correct name and address to enter private areas of a business.

## Restaurant's Social Media Statement
"We had an ICE scare yesterday and even though we're afraid of the repercussions of being vocal, we feel that it's also important to inform people that this is right at our front door. ICE is not some far away boogeyman."

## Tips Shared by Hola Arepa
1. Unless agents have a signed judicial warrant, they cannot enter a private area like the kitchen without your permission
2. Even if they lie and say they don't need a warrant, stand your ground and insist on paperwork
3. You have the right to refuse service and ask them to leave your private property if they don't have a warrant

## Context
This incident occurred during the early days of "Operation Metro Surge." Days earlier, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey announced the city was banning ICE from using city-owned parking lots to stage immigration operations.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Four independent sources (Bring Me The News, CBS Minnesota, KARE 11, Fox 9). Named witnesses (owner Christina Nguyen, GM Naomi Rathke). Restaurant posted about incident on social media. Example of successful resistance to warrantless entry. No detentions occurred.
