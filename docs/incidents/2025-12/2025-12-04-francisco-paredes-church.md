- Sleeping "on floor. No blanket"
- 40 people in one cell with one bathroom (Bloomington facility)
- No access to religious services over Christmas

## Church Surveillance (January 4, 2026)
Hopkins Mayor Patrick Hanlon reported:
- ICE agents were "definitely out in front of the church, waiting in front of the church" on Epiphany
- Pastor Fr. Paul Haverstock observed: "men wearing ski masks in a car outside the church"
- Vehicles had "out-of-state license plates"
- Agents were "apparently surveilling" the parish
- Agents did not enter the church

## Impact on Parish
- Spanish Mass attendance dropped from 400+ to approximately 200 after Paredes' arrest
- Pastor considering offering temporary Sunday Mass dispensation for those afraid to attend
- Church members creating "stumble stone" signs inspired by Holocaust memorials

## Official Accounts

### DHS Response
A DHS spokesperson said ICE "does not raid churches," calling such allegations "smears."

### Mayor Patrick Hanlon (Hopkins)
Confirmed the church surveillance incident and stated: "They came to our church, and even though they didn't enter, they were apparently surveilling us."

## Context
The Trump administration eliminated the federal policy that generally prohibited immigration enforcement in "sensitive locations" such as schools, churches, and hospitals in 2025.

## Editorial Assessment
**HIGH** - Multiple Catholic news outlets reporting with consistent details. Hopkins mayor on record confirming surveillance. Pastor statements included. Demonstrates sensitive location enforcement and the chilling effect on religious communities.
