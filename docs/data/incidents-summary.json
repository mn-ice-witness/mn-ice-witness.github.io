      "summary": "At a press conference following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino was asked whether Pretti ever reached for or brandished his weapon. Bovino stated the matter was under investigation: \"This is under investigation. Those facts will come to light, but let's take a look at the gun.\" Rather than directly answering whether Pretti reached for his weapon, Bovino pivoted to displaying a photo of Pretti's firearm, describing it as \"semi-automatic high capacity type, possibly a SIG Sauer.\" The shooting has sparked concern from Second Amendment advocacy groups, who argue that merely possessing a legal firearm does not justify lethal force. Gun Owners of America, Second Amendment Foundation, and Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus have all called for a full investigation.",
