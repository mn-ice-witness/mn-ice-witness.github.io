[Operation Metro Surge](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/minnesota-and-the-twin-cities-sue-the-federal-government-to-stop-trumps-immigration-crackdown) was launched by the Trump administration in December 2025, deploying roughly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what DHS has called its largest operation in history. The administration states that Operation Metro Surge targets individuals with criminal histories, gang affiliations, and outstanding removal orders.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) to prioritize arrests of gang members and individuals with violent criminal records. DHS press releases highlight arrests of individuals with criminal backgrounds.

The administration has also cited sanctuary city policies in Minneapolis and St. Paul as a factor in the scope of its enforcement operations. In a January 14, 2026 statement, DHS stated that local policies had resulted in the release of ["nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens"](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/14/mayor-freys-sanctuary-policies-release-criminal-illegal-aliens-jails-back).

<h2 id="the-data">Arrest Data <a href="#the-data" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

Independent analyses present different figures.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

**Regarding U.S. citizens:** Secretary Noem stated on October 30, 2025: "No American citizens have been arrested or detained." [PolitiFact rated this claim "Pants on Fire"](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/31/kristi-noem/immigration-ICE-arrest-US-citizen-Chicago/). [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598373/npr-fact-checks-kristi-noem-on-ice-detaining-us-citizens) and [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/has-ice-arrested-american-citizens/) also disputed the claim. ProPublica documented over 170 cases of U.S. citizens detained by immigration agents. [See full details](#2025-10-30-noem-no-citizens-arrested-claim).

This site compiles sourced, verified incidents from Minnesota during Operation Metro Surge (December 2025 – present).

### Categories

Incidents are organized into five categories:

- **Citizens** — U.S. citizens/legal residents detained while going about daily life (working, driving, shopping)
- **Observers** — People detained while filming, observing, or protesting ICE operations
- **Immigrants** — Non-criminal immigrants detained, including workplace raids
- **Schools/Hospitals** — Actions at or near schools, hospitals, and healthcare institutions
- **Response** — Official DHS/ICE statements about specific incidents

*Note: "Citizens" and "Observers" may both involve U.S. citizens. The distinction is whether they were encountered during routine activities (Citizens) or while engaged in observation/protest (Observers).*

### NEW/UPDATED

When enabled, incidents are sorted by when they were added or last had a significant update (e.g., judge ruling, person released). This lets you easily see new content if you visit the site regularly. With this off, in the 'List' view incidents are sorted by category and then by incident date.

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose <a href="#purpose" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

This site does not take a position on immigration policy. It documents reported incidents in Minnesota and the individuals affected.

The incidents documented here raise questions about the scope and conduct of enforcement operations. U.S. citizens and legal residents have reported being detained. Families have been separated. Observers have reported being pressured for information about organizers.

Every incident on this site includes source links to news reports, videos, official statements, and court documents. Readers can verify each claim independently.

<p class="about-note">Note: Even non-citizens accused of crimes have the right to have their civil rights respected, to be given due process under the law, and to have their humanity honored. As the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights">ACLU states</a>: "The fundamental constitutional protections of due process and equal protection embodied in the Constitution and Bill of Rights apply to every person."</p>

**Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) is a DHS fraud investigation program affecting refugees who entered the United States legally and are awaiting green cards.

According to [Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-fraud-dhs-launching-operation-parris-target-refugees-jan-9), an [official USCIS press release](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota), and the [Twin Cities Pioneer Press](https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/18/5600-green-card-applicants-in-minnesota-targeted-through-operation-parris/), approximately **5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota** are affected by this operation. These individuals have pending applications and are legally present in the country.

[Global Refuge reports](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) that lawfully admitted refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."

<h2 id="legal-observation">Legal Observation and Protest <a href="#legal-observation" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

Multiple incidents on this site involve disputes over filming and observer conduct. The following summarizes the legal framework.

**What is protected:** [Federal courts across at least ten circuits](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/yes-you-have-right-film-ice) have ruled that recording law enforcement in public is a First Amendment right ([NYCLU guide](https://www.nyclu.org/resources/know-your-rights/you-have-right-film-ice)). Verbal criticism — including profanity — is protected under [*City of Houston v. Hill* (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop). Whistles, chanting, and singing are [protected activities](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights), though narrowly-tailored noise restrictions may apply in specific contexts.

**What is not protected:** Physical obstruction — blocking officers, surrounding vehicles, or stepping between an agent and a detainee — can result in federal charges.

**Case outcomes:** A [ProPublica investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will) found that of ~130 Americans arrested for allegedly impeding ICE officers, nearly 50 were never charged or had charges dismissed. In [Chicago](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/charges-dropped-broadview-ice-protesters-grand-jury/) and [Portland](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/03/protestors-arrested-at-portland-ice-facility-wait-months-without-charges/), most protester charges were dropped.
