<h2 id="federal-position">The Federal Position <a href="#federal-position" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#link-icon"/></svg></a></h2>

[Operation Metro Surge](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/minnesota-and-the-twin-cities-sue-the-federal-government-to-stop-trumps-immigration-crackdown) was launched by the Trump administration in December 2025, deploying roughly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what DHS has called its largest operation in history. The Trump administration contends that Operation Metro Surge targets "the worst of the worst" — criminals, gang members, and individuals with serious criminal histories.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) "to target the worst of the worst—including gang members, murderers, and rapists." DHS press releases highlight arrests of individuals with criminal records. ICE's main [recruitment page](https://www.ice.gov/join) states: "America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out."

### Sanctuary City Justification

The administration has repeatedly cited sanctuary city policies in Minneapolis and St. Paul as justification for the scale and tactics of its enforcement operations in Minnesota. In a January 14, 2026 statement, DHS claimed that Mayor Frey's policies have resulted in the release of ["nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens"](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/14/mayor-freys-sanctuary-policies-release-criminal-illegal-aliens-jails-back) onto Minnesota streets, characterizing sanctuary policies as "dangerous."

This messaging pattern — highlighting individual criminal cases to justify broader operations — appears consistently in DHS responses to criticism of enforcement tactics. When incidents documented on this site have drawn public scrutiny, DHS has responded by pointing to sanctuary policies and criminal cases rather than addressing the specific circumstances of those incidents.

<h2 id="the-data">The Data: Who Is ICE Actually Arresting? <a href="#the-data" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#link-icon"/></svg></a></h2>

Independent analyses present different figures.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

**DHS claims about U.S. citizens have been fact-checked as false.** Secretary Noem stated on October 30, 2025: "No American citizens have been arrested or detained." [PolitiFact rated this claim "Pants on Fire"](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/31/kristi-noem/immigration-ICE-arrest-US-citizen-Chicago/) — their lowest truthfulness rating. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598373/npr-fact-checks-kristi-noem-on-ice-detaining-us-citizens) and [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/has-ice-arrested-american-citizens/) also found the claim to be inaccurate. ProPublica documented over 170 cases of U.S. citizens detained by immigration agents. [See full details](#2025-10-30-noem-no-citizens-arrested-claim).

This site compiles sourced, verified incidents from Minnesota during Operation Metro Surge (December 2025 – present).

### Categories

Incidents are organized into five categories:

- **Citizens** — U.S. citizens/legal residents randomly targeted while going about daily life (working, driving, shopping)
- **Observers** — People targeted for filming, observing, or protesting ICE operations
- **Immigrants** — Non-criminal immigrants detained, including workplace raids
- **Schools/Hospitals** — Actions at or near schools, hospitals, and healthcare institutions
- **Response** — Official DHS/ICE statements about specific incidents

*Note: "Citizens" and "Observers" may both involve U.S. citizens. The distinction is whether they were randomly targeted (Citizens) or targeted for their First Amendment activity (Observers).*

### NEW/UPDATED

When enabled, incidents are sorted by when they were added or last had a significant update (e.g., judge ruling, person released). This lets you easily see new content if you visit the site regularly. With this off, in the 'List' view incidents are sorted by category and then by incident date.

<h2 id="operation-parris">Operation PARRIS: Targeting Refugees with Legal Status <a href="#operation-parris" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#link-icon"/></svg></a></h2>

A documented pattern has emerged of ICE targeting refugees who entered the United States legally and are awaiting green cards under **Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening).

According to [Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-fraud-dhs-launching-operation-parris-target-refugees-jan-9), an [official USCIS press release](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota), and the [Twin Cities Pioneer Press](https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/18/5600-green-card-applicants-in-minnesota-targeted-through-operation-parris/), approximately **5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota** are being targeted through this operation. These are individuals who followed every rule, submitted their applications, and are legally present in the country.

[Global Refuge reports](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) that lawfully admitted refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."

This pattern is documented in incidents on this site including:
- [Silva Sosa parents detained 5 days after I-130 approval](#2026-01-12-silva-sosa-inver-grove-heights)
- [Moldovan refugee Nadya detained while driving to church with family](#2026-01-17-nadya-moldovan-refugee)

Multiple incidents on this site involve ICE agents warning observers not to film, or claiming "obstruction" against people at a distance. Supporters of ICE operations also argue that certain incidents are not civil rights concerns because observer behavior was unlawful. Here's what the law actually says.

**What is protected:** [Federal courts across at least ten circuits](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/yes-you-have-right-film-ice) have ruled that recording law enforcement in public is a First Amendment right ([NYCLU guide](https://www.nyclu.org/resources/know-your-rights/you-have-right-film-ice)). Verbal criticism — including profanity — is protected under [*City of Houston v. Hill* (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop). Whistles, chanting, and singing are [protected activities](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights), though narrowly-tailored noise restrictions may apply in specific contexts.

**What is not protected:** Physical obstruction — blocking officers, surrounding vehicles, or stepping between an agent and a detainee — can result in federal charges.

**What the data shows:** While DHS has [claimed](https://www.cato.org/commentary/dhs-says-videotaping-ice-agents-illegal-federal-courts-disagree) filming constitutes interference, [federal courts disagree](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/filming-the-police/). A [ProPublica investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will) found that of ~130 Americans arrested for allegedly impeding ICE officers, cases "often wilted under scrutiny" — nearly 50 were never charged or dismissed. In [Chicago](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/charges-dropped-broadview-ice-protesters-grand-jury/) and [Portland](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/03/protestors-arrested-at-portland-ice-facility-wait-months-without-charges/), most protester charges were dropped.
