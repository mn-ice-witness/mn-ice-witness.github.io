# About This Site

## The Official Claim

The Trump administration has consistently justified Operation Metro Surge and its broader immigration enforcement as targeting "the worst of the worst" — criminals, rapists, murderers, and gang members.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) "to target the worst of the worst—including gang members, murderers, and rapists." Press releases from DHS routinely highlight arrests of "pedophiles, domestic abusers, and violent gang members."

## The Data

The administration's own numbers tell a different story.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that only **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains just **9,738 people** — out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests**. That's **less than 5%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council observed: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

## Purpose

This site does not argue that immigration laws should not be enforced. It documents what is actually happening on the ground in Minnesota — and who is actually being affected.

The evidence shows that Operation Metro Surge is not a targeted operation against violent criminals. U.S. citizens are being detained, beaten, and arrested. Legal residents are being separated from their families. Children are being traumatized. Workers are being taken from their jobs. Observers exercising their First Amendment rights are being arrested and offered deals for information.

Every incident on this site includes source links to news reports, videos, official statements, and court documents. Readers can verify each claim independently.

## Sources Used

All incidents are documented using publicly available sources including:
- Minnesota local news (Star Tribune, MPR News, WCCO, KARE11, Sahan Journal)
- National news (AP, Reuters, CNN, PBS, NPR)
- Official statements from DHS, ICE, and local government
- Court filings and legal documents
- Video evidence and eyewitness accounts

Incidents are rated for trustworthiness (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNVERIFIED) based on the number and reliability of confirming sources.
