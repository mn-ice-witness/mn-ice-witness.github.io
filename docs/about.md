# About This Site

## The Federal Position

The Trump administration contends that Operation Metro Surge and its broader immigration enforcement targets "the worst of the worst" — criminals, gang members, and individuals with serious criminal histories.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) "to target the worst of the worst—including gang members, murderers, and rapists." DHS press releases highlight arrests of individuals with criminal records. ICE's main [recruitment page](https://www.ice.gov/join) states: "America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out."

## The Data

Independent analyses present different figures.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"
