[Operation Metro Surge](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/minnesota-and-the-twin-cities-sue-the-federal-government-to-stop-trumps-immigration-crackdown) was launched by the Trump administration in December 2025, deploying roughly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what DHS has called its largest operation in history.

<h2 id="what-this-site-documents">What This Site Documents <a href="#what-this-site-documents" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

This site compiles sourced, verified incidents from Minnesota during Operation Metro Surge (December 2025 – present).

### Categories

Incidents are organized into five categories:

- **Citizens / Legal Residents** — People with legal status detained while going about daily life (working, driving, shopping)
- **Observers** — People detained while filming, observing, following, or protesting ICE enforcement operations
- **Immigrants** — People without legal status detained, including workplace raids and asylum-seekers with pending cases
- **Schools/Hospitals** — Actions at or near schools, hospitals, and healthcare institutions
- **Response** — Official DHS/ICE statements about specific incidents

#### Citizens / Legal Residents vs. Immigrants: The Key Distinction

The distinction between these two categories is **legal status**, not citizenship:

| Citizens / Legal Residents | Immigrants |
|---------------------------|------------|
| **Has approved legal status** | **Does not have approved legal status** |
| U.S. citizens (born or naturalized) | Undocumented immigrants |
| Green card holders | Asylum-seekers with pending cases |
| Valid work visa holders | People with removal/deportation orders |
| Authorized refugees | Overstayed visas |
| TPS holders with work authorization | Pending applications without current authorization |

**Why this matters:** The "Citizens / Legal Residents" category documents people who have every legal right to be in the United States but were nonetheless detained, questioned, or had their rights violated. This includes not just U.S. citizens, but also green card holders, work visa holders, and authorized refugees — all of whom have legal status.

The "Immigrants" category documents people who do not currently have approved legal status. This includes asylum-seekers whose cases are still pending — even if they entered legally and filed proper paperwork, they do not yet have approved status. Many of these individuals have lived in Minnesota for years, raised families, paid taxes, and followed the rules while waiting for their cases to be processed.

*Note: "Citizens / Legal Residents" and "Observers" may both involve U.S. citizens. The distinction is whether they were targeted in racially-profiled enforcement operations (Citizens) or detained while filming or protesting (Observers).*

### A Note on Federal Position/Responses

The federal government has put forward two main arguments: (1) that enforcement targets dangerous criminals and the "worst of the worst," and (2) that local sanctuary city policies, rhetoric from state and city officials, and community "obstruction" are to blame for the confrontations and chaos seen in the streets of Minneapolis. Both are explored in detail below.

<h2 id="the-focus-on-criminals">Federal Position: Targeting Criminals and the "Worst of the Worst" <a href="#the-focus-on-criminals" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

**The administration's stated mission:** Operation Metro Surge is framed as targeting dangerous criminals. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) to prioritize arrests of gang members and individuals with violent criminal records. President Trump [defended enforcement operations](#2026-01-20-trump-mistakes-happen) by flipping through arrest records, stating agents are "apprehending murderers and drug dealers." DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV to highlight particularly dangerous individuals. This site includes many of their direct statements in the [Response](#response) category.

**What this site documents:** In addition to these responses, this site documents reported incidents that often directly contradict this framing. U.S. citizens racially profiled while driving, working, or shopping — detained without cause and later released. People arrested for filming or observing ICE operations, a First Amendment protected activity. Non-criminal immigrants who have lived and worked in Minnesota for years, raised families, paid taxes, and followed the rules — some caught in immigration paperwork bureaucracy, others [legally admitted refugees](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) affected by [Operation PARRIS](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota) who were detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with no access to an attorney.

**What the data shows:** National data tells a similar story. According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**. The "Worst of the Worst" database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%** ([Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database)). A [Star Tribune investigation](https://www.startribune.com/the-trump-administration-calls-them-the-worst-of-the-worst-heres-what-we-found/601555390) reviewed the 240 names DHS released and found that while 80% had felony convictions, nearly everyone had already served their time and was not actively wanted by police when detained.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

Secretary Noem stated on October 30, 2025: "No American citizens have been arrested or detained." [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/31/kristi-noem/immigration-ICE-arrest-US-citizen-Chicago/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598373/npr-fact-checks-kristi-noem-on-ice-detaining-us-citizens), and [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/has-ice-arrested-american-citizens/) found this statement to be inaccurate. ProPublica documented over 170 cases of U.S. citizens detained by immigration agents. [See full details](#2025-10-30-noem-no-citizens-arrested-claim).

<h2 id="local-blame">Federal Position: Local Policies and "Radical Obstruction" <a href="#local-blame" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

**The administration's argument:** The Trump administration contends that local policies and community resistance are to blame for confrontational enforcement scenes. Administration officials have directed sharp rhetoric at Governor Walz and Mayor Frey, accusing them of obstructing federal law enforcement. Border czar Tom Homan stated: "Let us in the damn jail. Frey and Walz could fix this today." DHS has accused Minneapolis of being a "sanctuary city" whose policies endanger public safety.

Administration officials have also blamed the rhetoric of local leaders for inciting dangerous confrontations. Following the [fatal shooting of Alex Pretti](#2026-01-24-alex-pretti-shooting), Vice President Vance called it "engineered chaos... the direct consequence of far left agitators, working with local authorities."

**What this site documents:** People arrested, detained, or physically confronted for filming, observing, following, or protesting ICE enforcement operations. Incidents documented on this site include phones snatched from people's hands while filming, U.S. citizens detained for hours for filming, and chemical agents deployed on observers.

Many Minnesotans believe ICE has shown a pattern of civil rights violations and abuses of power, and feel compelled to document operations for accountability. Others strongly disagree with the administration's immigration policy and enforcement strategy and believe it is their right to protest — often loudly and profanely. As [Alex Pretti's](#2026-01-24-alex-pretti-shooting) father told the [AP](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-minnesota-protester-alex-pretti-15ade7de6e19cb0291734e85dac763dc), before he was shot and killed by ICE agents his son was protesting because he was deeply troubled by ICE enforcement across Minnesota and the country.

The core dispute is where observation ends and obstruction begins. DHS argues that peacefully following agents constitutes obstruction because it "[summons crowds of antagonists](https://www.ktvu.com/news/ice-says-recording-agents-illegal-federal-judge-says-dhs-policy-unlawful-jan-2026)." However, DHS has never published official guidance specifying a legal distance for observation, what constitutes lawful protest, or whether following ICE vehicles on public roads is prohibited. Instead, DHS officials have made statements suggesting that *any* filming or following may be treated as illegal. Secretary Noem stated that "[videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations](https://reason.com/2026/01/08/you-have-the-right-to-record-ice/)" constitutes violence. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called videotaping agents "[doxing](https://www.cato.org/commentary/dhs-says-videotaping-ice-agents-illegal-federal-courts-disagree)" that will be prosecuted. In Minnesota, agents have told observers it is "illegal" to follow and record — with video showing agents [snatching phones](#2026-01-11-observer-phone-snatched) from people filming.

**What the law says:** [Federal courts across at least ten circuits](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/yes-you-have-right-film-ice) have ruled that recording law enforcement in public is a First Amendment right. Verbal criticism — including profanity — is protected under [*City of Houston v. Hill* (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop). Whistles, chanting, and singing are [protected activities](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights). On following, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez [ruled](https://www.aclu-mn.org/press-releases/1a/) that "safely following Covered Federal Agents at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop" — though the 8th Circuit issued an administrative stay while appeals proceed. Physical obstruction — blocking officers, surrounding vehicles, or stepping between an agent and a detainee — is not protected and can result in federal charges.
