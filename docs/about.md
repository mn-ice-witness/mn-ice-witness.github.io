## The Federal Position

The Trump administration contends that Operation Metro Surge and its broader immigration enforcement targets "the worst of the worst" — criminals, gang members, and individuals with serious criminal histories.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) "to target the worst of the worst—including gang members, murderers, and rapists." DHS press releases highlight arrests of individuals with criminal records. ICE's main [recruitment page](https://www.ice.gov/join) states: "America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out."

**DHS claims about U.S. citizens have been fact-checked as false.** Secretary Noem stated on October 30, 2025: "No American citizens have been arrested or detained." [PolitiFact rated this claim "Pants on Fire"](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/31/kristi-noem/immigration-ICE-arrest-US-citizen-Chicago/) — their lowest truthfulness rating. [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598373/npr-fact-checks-kristi-noem-on-ice-detaining-us-citizens) and [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/has-ice-arrested-american-citizens/) also debunked the claim. ProPublica documented over 170 cases of U.S. citizens detained by immigration agents. [See full details](#2025-10-30-noem-no-citizens-arrested-claim).

## The Data

Independent analyses present different figures.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

## Purpose

This site does not take a position on immigration policy. It documents reported incidents in Minnesota and the individuals affected.

The incidents documented here raise questions about the scope and conduct of enforcement operations. U.S. citizens and legal residents have reported being detained. Families have been separated. Observers have reported being pressured for information about organizers.

Every incident on this site includes source links to news reports, videos, official statements, and court documents. Readers can verify each claim independently.

<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #666; margin-top: 1.5em;">Note: Even non-citizens accused of crimes have the right to have their civil rights respected, to be given due process under the law, and to have their humanity honored. As the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/immigrants-rights">ACLU states</a>: "The fundamental constitutional protections of due process and equal protection embodied in the Constitution and Bill of Rights apply to every person."</p>

## Sources Used

All incidents are documented using publicly available sources including:
- Minnesota local news (Star Tribune, MPR News, WCCO, KARE11, Sahan Journal)
- National news (AP, Reuters, CNN, PBS, NPR)
- Official statements from DHS, ICE, and local government
- Court filings and legal documents
- Video evidence and eyewitness accounts

Incidents are rated for trustworthiness (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNVERIFIED) based on source quantity, quality, and corroboration — including whether reports come from major investigative outlets, include video/photo evidence, or feature official confirmations and named witnesses.
