[Operation Metro Surge](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/minnesota-and-the-twin-cities-sue-the-federal-government-to-stop-trumps-immigration-crackdown) was launched by the Trump administration in December 2025, deploying roughly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in what DHS has called its largest operation in history.

<h2 id="what-this-site-documents">What This Site Documents <a href="#what-this-site-documents" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

This site compiles sourced, verified incidents from Minnesota during Operation Metro Surge (December 2025 – present).

### Categories

Incidents are organized into five categories:

- **Citizens** — U.S. citizens/legal residents detained while going about daily life (working, driving, shopping)
- **Observers** — People detained while filming, observing, or protesting ICE operations
- **Immigrants** — Non-criminal immigrants detained, including workplace raids
- **Schools/Hospitals** — Actions at or near schools, hospitals, and healthcare institutions
- **Response** — Official DHS/ICE statements about specific incidents

*Note: "Citizens" and "Observers" may both involve U.S. citizens. The distinction is whether they were targeted in racially-profiled enforcement operations (Citizens) or detained while filming or protesting (Observers). A few Citizens incidents involve other circumstances.*

<h2 id="notes-on-response">Notes on Response <a href="#notes-on-response" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

This site includes a **Response** category to document official statements from DHS and ICE about specific incidents. We attempt to find and include official responses wherever available.

**The administration's position:** The Trump administration has argued that street enforcement operations would be less disruptive if local authorities cooperated more fully with ICE. Border czar Tom Homan stated: "Let us in the damn jail. Frey and Walz could fix this today." The administration contends that when counties decline to honor ICE detainer requests, agents must conduct arrests in the community rather than in controlled jail settings — which the administration argues leads to the confrontational scenes documented in many of these incidents.

In a January 14, 2026 statement, DHS stated that sanctuary city policies in Minneapolis and St. Paul had resulted in the release of ["nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens"](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2026/01/14/mayor-freys-sanctuary-policies-release-criminal-illegal-aliens-jails-back). A [New York Times investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/22/us/ice-minnesota-inmates.html) found the situation is more complex: Minnesota state prisons do transfer inmates to ICE upon release (84 last year), but county jails have varying policies, and some sheriffs cite legal liability concerns after lawsuits found detaining people solely on ICE requests exceeded their authority.

DHS has also cited [hostile crowds creating unsafe conditions](/entry/2026-01-21-dhs-response-crowd-control) — including incidents where agents were followed to gas stations, had food thrown at them, and in one instance an agent was spit on. The administration argues that such confrontations create tense environments where split-second decisions must be made, and that verbal harassment (yelling, whistles, crowds surrounding vehicles) contributes to dangerous situations for both officers and the public.

**Public opinion and administration response:** A [New York Times/Siena poll](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/politics/ice-immigration-republicans-voters.html) (Jan 12-17, 2026) found that **61% of voters** said ICE tactics have "gone too far," including **71% of independents** and **19% of Republicans**. Only 26% said tactics were "about right."

In response to growing criticism, ICE has held [near-daily press conferences](https://www.startribune.com/decrying-false-narrative-ice-leaders-aim-to-shift-perspective-of-immigration-crackdown-in-minneapolis/601568859) highlighting arrests of individuals with criminal histories. On January 23, ICE Assistant Director Marcos Charles stated: "The public needs to know about the dangerous criminal illegal aliens we're arresting; they need to see the faces of the monsters these agitators are trying to protect." Vice President Vance visited Minneapolis the same week, saying the administration wanted to "lower the temperature" while maintaining that "many of those most viral stories of the past couple weeks have turned out to be at best partially true."

Some Republican lawmakers have expressed caution. Senator Susan Collins of Maine raised concerns about "excessive" ICE tactics. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) told Politico: "They need to show more balance in enforcement and more compassion and empathy in enforcement."

<h2 id="legal-observation">Legal Observation and Protest <a href="#legal-observation" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

Multiple incidents on this site involve disputes over filming and observer conduct. Legal observers and civil liberties organizations maintain that filming and verbal protest are constitutionally protected activities, and that the presence of witnesses serves a public accountability function. Courts have issued injunctions limiting the use of force against peaceful observers. The question of what constitutes "obstruction" versus protected observation remains contested in multiple pending cases.

**What is protected:** [Federal courts across at least ten circuits](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/yes-you-have-right-film-ice) have ruled that recording law enforcement in public is a First Amendment right ([NYCLU guide](https://www.nyclu.org/resources/know-your-rights/you-have-right-film-ice)). Verbal criticism — including profanity — is protected under [*City of Houston v. Hill* (1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop). Whistles, chanting, and singing are [protected activities](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/protesters-rights), though narrowly-tailored noise restrictions may apply in specific contexts.

**What is not protected:** Physical obstruction — blocking officers, surrounding vehicles, or stepping between an agent and a detainee — can result in federal charges.

**Case outcomes:** A [ProPublica investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/immigration-dhs-american-citizens-arrested-detained-against-will) found that of ~130 Americans arrested for allegedly impeding ICE officers, nearly 50 were never charged or had charges dismissed. In [Chicago](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/charges-dropped-broadview-ice-protesters-grand-jury/) and [Portland](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/03/protestors-arrested-at-portland-ice-facility-wait-months-without-charges/), most protester charges were dropped.

<h2 id="the-data">"Criminals and Murderers" & Arrest Data <a href="#the-data" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

The administration states that Operation Metro Surge targets individuals with criminal histories, gang affiliations, and outstanding removal orders. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem [directed ICE](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/12/19/under-president-trump-and-secretary-noem-department-homeland-security-has-historic) to prioritize arrests of gang members and individuals with violent criminal records. DHS press releases highlight arrests of individuals with criminal backgrounds. President Trump [defended enforcement operations](#2026-01-20-trump-mistakes-happen) by flipping through arrest records, stating agents are "apprehending murderers and drug dealers" while acknowledging agents "make mistakes sometimes." A [Star Tribune investigation](https://www.startribune.com/the-trump-administration-calls-them-the-worst-of-the-worst-heres-what-we-found/601555390) reviewed the 240 names DHS released and found that while 80% had felony convictions, nearly everyone had already served their time and was not actively wanted by police when detained.

Critics contend the data tells a different story.

According to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/07/12/ice-raids-trump-immigration-crackdown-deportation-no-criminal-convictions/), **72% of ICE detainees have no criminal convictions**. The Cato Institute found that **5% of those booked into ICE detention had violent criminal convictions**, while **73% had no convictions at all**.

DHS created a "Worst of the Worst" database at WOW.DHS.GOV. According to [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org/news/dhs-worst-of-worst-database), this database contains **9,738 people** out of more than **220,000 ICE arrests** — approximately **4%**.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council noted: "DHS is implicitly admitting that less than 5% of the people it arrests are people they believe are 'the worst of the worst.'"

**Regarding U.S. citizens:** Secretary Noem stated on October 30, 2025: "No American citizens have been arrested or detained." [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/31/kristi-noem/immigration-ICE-arrest-US-citizen-Chicago/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/05/nx-s1-5598373/npr-fact-checks-kristi-noem-on-ice-detaining-us-citizens), and [Poynter](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/has-ice-arrested-american-citizens/) found this statement to be inaccurate. ProPublica documented over 170 cases of U.S. citizens detained by immigration agents. [See full details](#2025-10-30-noem-no-citizens-arrested-claim).

<h2 id="operation-parris">Operation PARRIS <a href="#operation-parris" class="header-link" title="Copy link"><svg width="16" height="16"><use href="#icon-link"/></svg></a></h2>

**Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) is a DHS fraud investigation program affecting refugees who entered the United States legally and are awaiting green cards.

According to [Fox 9](https://www.fox9.com/news/minnesota-fraud-dhs-launching-operation-parris-target-refugees-jan-9), an [official USCIS press release](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-launches-landmark-uscis-fraud-investigation-in-minnesota), and the [Twin Cities Pioneer Press](https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/18/5600-green-card-applicants-in-minnesota-targeted-through-operation-parris/), approximately **5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota** are affected by this operation. These individuals have pending applications and are legally present in the country.

[Global Refuge reports](https://www.globalrefuge.org/news/refugee-arrests-minnesota/) that lawfully admitted refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."
