Thanks for reaching out! Yes, happy to chat about what we're seeing in Minnesota.

The short version: we've listed 24+ cases of U.S. citizens detained or profiled by ICE since December 2025 that were covered by a reputable media source (the actual number is of course much higher). The disruptions range from minor (scary afternoon, released) to severe (multi-day detention, seizures, hospitalized children, broken doors, lost jobs).

There are many stories listed on our site - let us know if you'd like a longer email with specific cases, but I'm guessing you've seen most of them in the news.

The patterns we're seeing: targeting based on skin color, accent, or speaking non-English languages. Agents often refuse to check ID when offered. Extended detentions (5-12+ hours, sometimes days) without charges. Physical force. Property damage. Kids watching parents get taken.

Our full database is at https://mn-ice-witness.org/ - you can filter by citizens or observers. Everything is sourced and we try to verify against multiple reports.

Happy to hop on a call if that's easier. What else would be helpful?
