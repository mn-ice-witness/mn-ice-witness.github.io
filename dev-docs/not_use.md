# Stories Not to Use

This file tracks stories that were considered but determined not to be a good fit for the project. Check this list before adding new incidents to avoid re-adding stories that were already evaluated and rejected.

## Criteria for Exclusion

Stories are excluded when they don't meet the project's core focus:
1. **Protest-only coverage** - Stories that only cover protests/walkouts without a direct civil rights incident
2. **Opinion pieces** - Editorials without factual incident reporting
3. **Duplicate coverage** - Same incident already documented under different headline
4. **Criminal investigations** - Raids tied to drug trafficking, weapons, or other criminal investigations (not immigration-only enforcement)
5. **Detainees with criminal convictions** - Cases where majority of those detained had prior criminal records
6. **Political/institutional stories** - Stories about political responses, resignations, investigations, or institutional actions that don't document a specific civil rights incident (e.g., prosecutors resigning, DOJ investigations, legislative hearings)

## Excluded Stories

### January 2026

**Class Action Lawsuit Against Operation PARRIS (Jan 24)**
- Sources: [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-federal-operation-targeting-minnesotas-legal-refugees/601570032), [IRAP](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/refugees-sue-trump-administration-to-stop-ice-terror-campaign)
- Date: January 24, 2026
- Details: Five refugees and legal groups (IRAP, Berger Montague, CHRCL, Advocates for Human Rights) filed class action lawsuit against federal officials over Operation PARRIS, which is re-examining ~5,600 Minnesota refugees' status. Lawsuit alleges violations of Immigration and Nationality Act and Constitution; seeks to stop warrantless arrests and coercive interrogation of lawfully present refugees.
- Reason: **Legal/policy story** - documents legal challenge to systemic program, not a specific civil rights incident. Individual refugee detentions under Operation PARRIS are documented as separate incidents.
- Date evaluated: 2026-01-25

**Mayo Clinic Healthcare Workers Walkout (Jan 23)**
- Sources: [MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/23/health-care-providers-at-mayo-clinic-walk-out-in-protest-of-ice-cbp-operations)
- Date: January 23, 2026
- Details: Mayo Clinic medical residents and fellows organized a 15-minute walkout in Rochester to call for an end to federal immigration enforcement actions. Similar walkouts at Hennepin Healthcare and University of Minnesota. Providers noted patients are afraid to come in for appointments and pick up prescriptions.
- Reason: **Protest coverage only** - documents healthcare worker protest, not a civil rights incident or enforcement action against a person.
- Date evaluated: 2026-01-25

**Fong Khang Pardoned Then Detained (Jan 21)**
- Sources: [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/he-was-pardoned-by-the-state-on-tuesday-picked-up-by-ice-on-wednesday/601568766)
- Date: January 21, 2026
- Details: Fong Khang, 46, a legal permanent resident since 1983, was detained by ICE less than 24 hours after receiving a unanimous pardon from the Minnesota Board of Pardons (Walz, Ellison, Hudson) for 8 criminal convictions from nearly 20 years ago (thefts, driving without license, false info to police). He owns two auto repair shops in the Twin Cities. Now detained in Texas facing deportation to Laos. His lawsuit claims the pardon "eliminates any legal basis for removal."
- Reason: **Detainee with criminal convictions.** While the state pardon is notable, Khang had a documented criminal history that made him deportable under federal law. This is a legal/policy story about whether state pardons can eliminate federal deportation grounds, not a civil rights abuse case. The core question is constitutional (federal vs state authority), not ICE misconduct.

**Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Allen, William Kelly Arrests (Jan 22)**
- Sources: [KARE 11](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/ice-in-minnesota/nekima-levy-armstrong-arrested-in-cities-church-protest/89-ab545f86-3057-4ad3-b460-b250df95deba), [MPR News](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/22/nekima-levy-armstrong-arrested-cities-church-protest), [CBS Minnesota](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/church-protesters-minneapolis-charges-federal-face-act/)
- Date: January 22, 2026
- Details: Attorney General Pam Bondi announced FBI/ICE arrested three people for their roles in the Jan 18 Cities Church protest: civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong, St. Paul school board member Chauntyll Allen, and William Kelly. Charged under 18 USC 241 (conspiracy against rights) and FACE Act violations. Armstrong released same day after judge rejected detention request.
- Reason: **Political/institutional arrests by DOJ/FBI, not ICE enforcement.** While these individuals were protesting ICE, they were arrested by FBI for disrupting church services (FACE Act violation), not for filming/observing ICE operations. This is federal retaliation for anti-ICE activism, not a civil rights incident involving ICE enforcement against an individual. The underlying church protest was already excluded (see "Cities Church St. Paul Anti-ICE Protest" below).

**ICE Agent Shoots Venezuelan Man in North Minneapolis (Jan 14)**
- Sources: NPR, CNN, Fox News, CBS Minnesota, Fox 9, [Star Tribune (FBI details)](https://www.startribune.com/fbi-reveals-how-mistaken-identity-by-ice-led-to-chase-shooting-of-venezuelan-immigrant-in-north-minneapolis/601567978), [Sahan Journal (release ordered)](https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/ice-north-minneapolis-shooting-detainees-released/)
- Date: January 14, 2026
- Details: ICE agent shot Venezuelan man (Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis) in the leg during arrest operation. DHS claims agent was "ambushed" by three men with shovels after a traffic stop. Hundreds of protesters gathered; tear gas deployed.
- **UPDATE (Jan 22):** FBI affidavit reveals ICE originally targeted someone else—the shooting resulted from mistaken identity. The two men being pursued were longtime friends and fellow DoorDash drivers, not the target of the traffic stop. Federal judge ordered both men released on their own recognizance.
- Reason: **Not a clear abuse of power case.** While tragic, this incident does not demonstrate an obvious unlawful use of authority. DHS claims agent was attacked with shovels during the arrest—this is disputed but not clearly disproven. Project incidents should document clear abuses or unconstitutional actions by ICE, not contested use-of-force cases where the facts are still under investigation. Note: The tear gas impact on children is documented separately in `2026-01-14-shawn-jackson-children-tear-gas.md`. The FBI's mistaken identity revelation complicates the narrative but doesn't change the core issue: this was a contested use-of-force case, not a clear abuse.

- Details: Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, from Nicaragua, was detained by ICE in Minneapolis on Jan 6 and died on Jan 14 at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas. ICE reports "presumed suicide."

- Details: Federal agents deployed chemical irritants at Whipple Building protests, allegedly violating the Jan 17 court order prohibiting such tactics against peaceful protesters. Tensions escalated Saturday evening.
- Reason: Protest/legal story - documents potential court order violation but no specific individual victim detained or harmed in enforcement action. The court order violation may be relevant for legal filings but does not constitute a standalone civil rights incident file.
