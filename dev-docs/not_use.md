# Stories Not to Use

This file tracks stories that were considered but determined not to be a good fit for the project. Check this list before adding new incidents to avoid re-adding stories that were already evaluated and rejected.

## Criteria for Exclusion

Stories are excluded when they don't meet the project's core focus:
1. **Protest-only coverage** - Stories that only cover protests/walkouts without a direct civil rights incident
2. **Opinion pieces** - Editorials without factual incident reporting
3. **Duplicate coverage** - Same incident already documented under different headline
4. **Criminal investigations** - Raids tied to drug trafficking, weapons, or other criminal investigations (not immigration-only enforcement)
5. **Detainees with criminal convictions** - Cases where majority of those detained had prior criminal records
6. **Political/institutional stories** - Stories about political responses, resignations, investigations, or institutional actions that don't document a specific civil rights incident (e.g., prosecutors resigning, DOJ investigations, legislative hearings)

## Excluded Stories

### January 2026

**ICE Agent Shoots Venezuelan Man in North Minneapolis (Jan 14)**
- Sources: NPR, CNN, Fox News, CBS Minnesota, Fox 9
- Date: January 14, 2026
- Details: ICE agent shot Venezuelan man (Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis) in the leg during arrest operation. DHS claims agent was "ambushed" by three men with shovels after a traffic stop. Hundreds of protesters gathered; tear gas deployed.
- Reason: **Not a clear abuse of power case.** While tragic, this incident does not demonstrate an obvious unlawful use of authority. DHS claims agent was attacked with shovels during the arrest—this is disputed but not clearly disproven. Project incidents should document clear abuses or unconstitutional actions by ICE, not contested use-of-force cases where the facts are still under investigation. Note: The tear gas impact on children is documented separately in `2026-01-14-shawn-jackson-children-tear-gas.md`.

- Reason: Custody death after proper detention - not an enforcement civil rights incident.
