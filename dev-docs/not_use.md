# Stories Not to Use

This file tracks stories that were considered but determined not to be a good fit for the project. Check this list before adding new incidents to avoid re-adding stories that were already evaluated and rejected.

## Criteria for Exclusion

Stories are excluded when they don't meet the project's core focus:
1. **Protest-only coverage** - Stories that only cover protests/walkouts without a direct civil rights incident
2. **Opinion pieces** - Editorials without factual incident reporting
3. **Duplicate coverage** - Same incident already documented under different headline
