# Researching Official Federal Responses

This guide details how to find and document official DHS/ICE responses to incidents.

## Why Document Responses

The Response tab provides a factual record of how the federal government justifies its actions. This serves to:
- Document the official narrative
- Allow readers to compare claims against evidence
- Provide complete context for each incident

## Primary Sources

### DHS Press Releases
**URL:** https://www.dhs.gov/news-releases/press-releases

DHS issues daily press releases during Operation Metro Surge highlighting arrests and criminal histories. Search for:
- "Minneapolis"
- "Minnesota"
- "Operation Metro Surge"

### ICE News Releases
**URL:** https://www.ice.gov/news/releases

ICE publishes individual arrest announcements with detailed criminal history claims. These are often more detailed than DHS summaries.

### X/Twitter Accounts

Official accounts that post arrest justifications:
- **@DHSgov** - Department of Homeland Security
- **@ICEgov** - Immigration and Customs Enforcement
- **@TriciaEMcL** - DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (frequent spokesman)
- **@Abordar** - CBP official account

Search these accounts for:
- Posts mentioning Minneapolis/Minnesota
- Posts about specific incidents documented on this site
- "Worst of the worst" compilations

**Note:** Claude cannot directly search X.com/Twitter. Provide URLs from manual searches or use the WebSearch tool with `site:x.com` queries.

## What to Document

For each official response, document:

1. **Date and source** - When and where the statement was made
2. **Full quote** - The exact language used
3. **Criminal history claims** - Specific charges/convictions cited
4. **Officials quoted** - Who made the statement
5. **Context** - What incident they're responding to (if identifiable)

## Linking Responses to Incidents

When a response relates to a documented incident:
1. Add a `## DHS Response` section to the incident file
2. Create a separate `response` type file for the Response tab
3. Cross-reference between them

## Fact-Checking Claims

When possible, note:
- Whether criminal history claims can be independently verified
- Discrepancies between official claims and other evidence
- When claims are unverified (not that they're false, just unverified)

## Example Response File

See `dev-docs/incident-schema.md` for the full template.
