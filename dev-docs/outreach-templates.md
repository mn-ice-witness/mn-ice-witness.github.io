## General Outreach

### Brief Version

```
I've been building a database documenting ICE incidents in Minnesota:

https://mn-ice-witness.org/

Every incident is sourced from reputable media. The Media tab lets you scroll through key moments quickly. No logins, no popups, no ads.

If you're able to share this, I'd really appreciate it.
```

### Medium Version

```
I've been working on a project documenting ICE incidents in Minnesota:

https://mn-ice-witness.org/

The purpose is twofold:

1. Create the lowest-friction way possible for people to see what's happening—no social media logins, no popups, no paywalls. Every video is edited to the key moment, with full sources available if you want to dig deeper.

2. Maintain a comprehensive, running list of all sourced incidents.

The site focuses on incidents that challenge the narrative that this is simply about deporting criminals.

I'm trying to reach people who aren't following this closely or who may lean conservative but could have their minds opened to what's actually happening here.

If you're able to share this with anyone who might benefit from seeing it, I'd really appreciate it. No pressure if it's not your thing.

## For Journalists / Media Contacts

```
I'm a software developer working on this project:

https://mn-ice-witness.org/

It's a database of all sourced ICE incidents in Minnesota—every entry comes from reputable media reporting. The goal is to create the lowest-friction way possible for people to see the scope of what's happening.

I thought this might be useful for your reporting, or something you'd be interested in sharing. Happy to answer any questions about specific incidents or sources.

## Responding to Conservative-Leaning Commenters

### Short, Compassionate Response

```
I hear you, and I understand the frustration about border policy. I don't think most people on any side want chaos or lawlessness.

But I do think we can enforce immigration law while still respecting due process and constitutional rights. When ICE stops a U.S. citizen Uber driver based solely on the color of his skin, or uses excessive force without any apparent accountability—those aren't features of good enforcement.

Here's that Uber driver incident—he's an American citizen:

Here's a site with documented incidents from Minnesota. Every entry is sourced from local news. You might not agree with my conclusions, but I think the facts are worth seeing:

```

### Longer Version (For Engaged Discussions)

```
I appreciate you engaging on this. I think we probably agree on more than it seems.

I believe in the rule of law. I believe countries have the right to control their borders. I understand the frustration when it feels like the system has been broken for decades.

Where I get concerned is when enforcement crosses lines that shouldn't be crossed:

- U.S. citizens stopped or detained because of how they look
- Excessive force with no apparent accountability or discipline
- Children separated from parents with no plan for reunification

Here's a U.S. citizen Uber driver stopped based solely on the color of his skin:
https://mn-ice-witness.org/#2026-01-08-ahmed-hassan-uber-driver

And here's video of an arrest where excessive force was used. I haven't seen any indication that ICE has followed up with discipline for incidents like this:
https://mn-ice-witness.org/#2026-01-09-juan-carlos-brutality

These aren't about whether we should have borders. They're about whether enforcement respects basic rights and due process—things conservatives have historically championed. And whether there's any accountability when agents cross the line.

Here's a site documenting incidents from Minnesota. Everything is sourced from local news reporting—no activist claims, just journalism. Even if you disagree with my perspective, I think seeing what's actually happening is worthwhile:

https://mn-ice-witness.org/

The List tab shows every incident. The Media tab lets you scroll through video clips. No accounts, no popups, no agenda beyond showing what's documented.

## Quick Follow-up (After Initial Contact)

```
Thanks for considering it. Even just sending the link to one or two people who might not be following this closely would help. I'm finding the site resonates most with people outside Minnesota who haven't seen the day-to-day coverage.

## Tips for Outreach

- **Lead with the site, not politics**: Let the documented incidents speak for themselves
- **Emphasize low friction**: No logins, no popups, no paywalls—this matters to people
- **Mention sourcing**: Everything from reputable media helps credibility
- **Target people outside MN**: They're often less aware and more receptive
- **Be gracious about "no"**: No pressure messaging keeps doors open
- **For conservatives**: Focus on rule of law, due process, and constitutional rights—values they share
