## Candidates to Research (Need Media)

### 1. Christian Molina Car Rammed - Racial Profiling (Jan 12)
- **File:** `2026-01-12-christian-molina-car-rammed.md`
- **Location:** East 35th Street near Park Avenue, Minneapolis
- **Story:** ICE agents followed and rammed into car of Latino U.S. citizen, demanded ID based on appearance, released him after confirming citizenship
- **Quote:** "Because I look Latino, that's it, I don't look white or got blue eyes."
- **Crowd:** ~100 observers gathered, City Council Member Jason Chavez present
- **Media Status:** NO video/photo in file - worth researching
- **Potential:** Strong racial profiling story, happened 2 blocks from Renee Good shooting site

### 2. Rochester Hammer on Window (Jan 8-9)
- **File:** `2026-01-08-rochester-gates-complex.md`
- **Location:** Rochester, MN
- **Story:** ICE agent used hammer to try to break car window during warrantless detention
- **Witness:** David Perdono (COPAL) witnessed "one case where there was no warrant and someone was detained, with an officer having 'a hammer in his hand trying to open this person's window.'"
- **Media Status:** KIMT video of different arrest exists; hammer incident video unknown
- **Potential:** Unique visual of hammer being used - worth researching COPAL or local video

### 3. Mankato Women Sprayed (Jan 13)

- **Location:** Near Mankato East High School

- **Location:** Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Mary, Richfield
- **Story:** Elderly couple (late 60s) had guns pointed at them after following ICE vehicle from church raid
- **Media Status:** NO video - only lawsuit documents
- **Potential:** ACLU lawsuit plaintiffs - compelling story but may never have video

### 5. Rosemount Gun Threat (Jan, date unknown)
- **File:** `2026-01-unknown-rosemount-gun-threat.md`
- **Location:** Rosemount, MN
- **Story:** ICE agent waved gun sideways at motorist in threatening manner

## Rejected Candidates

### Burnsville Raid - 7-Year-Old Without Parents (Dec 6)
- **File:** `2025-12-06-burnsville-family-separated.md`
- **Date Rejected:** 2026-01-15

- **Story:** Ring camera captured ICE following couple home from grocery shopping, breaking down doors; parents of 7-year-old detained; guns pointed at U.S. citizens

4. **LOW:** Elderly couple (lawsuit-based, probably no video)
5. **LOW:** Rosemount (unverified, needs sourcing first)
