# Source Credibility Tiers

This document defines how we categorize news sources for trustworthiness assessments. The distinction is not about political bias but about **editorial standards, fact-checking processes, and accountability**.

## Tier 1: Established News Organizations

These outlets have professional editorial standards, fact-checking processes, corrections policies, and institutional accountability. Coverage from these sources generally supports a **HIGH** trustworthiness rating.

### National
- New York Times
- Washington Post
- Associated Press (AP)
- Reuters
- NPR
- PBS NewsHour
- CNN
- NBC News / MSNBC
- CBS News
- ABC News
- Fox News (news division, not opinion)
- The Guardian
- BBC
- Wall Street Journal

### Minnesota Local
- Star Tribune
- Pioneer Press (Twin Cities)
- MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)
- Fox 9 (KMSP)
- KARE 11 (NBC affiliate)
- KSTP (ABC affiliate)
- CBS Minnesota (WCCO)
- Sahan Journal
- Minnesota Reformer
- MinnPost
- Bring Me The News
- West Central Tribune
- Rochester Post-Bulletin
- Duluth News Tribune

### Investigative / Long-form
- The Intercept
- ProPublica
- The Marshall Project
- Reveal (Center for Investigative Reporting)
- The Appeal

## Tier 2: Secondary News Sources

These outlets may aggregate, summarize, or provide commentary on news. They often rely on Tier 1 reporting. Coverage **only from these sources** generally supports a **MEDIUM** trustworthiness rating.

### News Aggregators
- Raw Story
- Alternet
- The Hill
- Axios
- HuffPost
- Daily Beast
- Newsweek (digital)
- Business Insider

### International (covering US news)
- IBTimes UK
- The Independent (UK)
- Daily Mail (use cautiously)

### Commentary/Analysis Sites
- The Bulwark
- Vox
- Slate
- Salon

## Tier 3: Social Media & Content Farms

These sources lack editorial oversight and may simply repost viral content without verification. Coverage **only from these sources** generally supports a **MEDIUM or LOW** trustworthiness rating, depending on video/documentation quality.

### Social Media Platforms
- TikTok
- X/Twitter
- Instagram
- Threads
- Facebook
- YouTube (user uploads)
- Bluesky

### Content Aggregators / Viral Sites
- Inkl
- The Nerd Stash
- MundoNow
- Distractify
- BuzzFeed (non-news)
- Various "viral news" sites

**Note:** Social media CAN be valuable primary source material when it contains:
- Original video of an incident
- First-person accounts from victims/witnesses
- Named individuals making verifiable claims

The issue is when Tier 3 sources are the **only** coverage—meaning no journalist has independently verified the claims.

## How This Affects Trustworthiness Ratings

| Source Mix | Typical Rating |
|------------|----------------|
| 2+ Tier 1 sources | HIGH |
| 1 Tier 1 + corroborating details | HIGH |
| Multiple Tier 2 sources | MEDIUM-HIGH (use MEDIUM) |
| Tier 2 only | MEDIUM |
| Tier 3 with strong video/documentation | MEDIUM |
| Tier 3 only, no video | LOW |
| Single unverified social media post | UNVERIFIED |

## Why This Matters

Tier 1 sources have:
- **Editors** who review stories before publication
- **Fact-checkers** who verify claims
- **Corrections policies** when errors occur
- **Legal accountability** for defamation
- **Journalists** with training and professional standards
- **Institutional reputation** at stake

Tier 3 sources often:
- Repost content without verification
- Lack editorial review
- Have no corrections process
- May sensationalize or misrepresent facts
- Face no accountability for errors

## Examples

**HIGH trustworthiness:** "Incident covered by Star Tribune, Fox 9, and MPR News with named victim and official statements."

**MEDIUM trustworthiness:** "Viral TikTok video shows incident clearly. Multiple social media reposts and coverage by IBTimes UK. No Minnesota local news coverage found."

**LOW trustworthiness:** "Single Facebook post claims incident occurred. No video, no named witnesses, no news coverage."
