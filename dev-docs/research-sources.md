## Social Media (Needs Corroboration)

- `@ICEgov` - ICE official
- `@CBP` - Border Patrol official
- `@GovTimWalz` - Governor
- `@MayorFrey` - Minneapolis Mayor
- `@MelvinCarter` - St. Paul Mayor
- `@keaborgen` - Reporter, Star Tribune
- `@AlishaRyu` - MPR News immigration reporter

### Finding Social Media Posts

When user provides Facebook/X links:

1. Note the date and description
2. Search news sites for corroboration
3. Check if news outlets embedded the video
4. Use archive.today if needed

## Video Evidence

### YouTube Searches
- "ICE Minneapolis"
- "Border Patrol Minnesota"
- "Roosevelt High School ICE"
- Specific incident + "video"

### News Video
Most local stations have video on their websites.

## Legal Documents

### Where to Find
- PACER (federal court filings)
- MN Attorney General press releases
- ACLU litigation announcements

### Current Cases
- MN v. DHS (Ellison lawsuit against ICE surge)
- Individual habeas petitions

## Research Workflow

### For a New Incident

1. **Start with news search**
   - Google News: `site:startribune.com ICE [date]`
   - Or: `Minneapolis ICE [location] [date]`

2. **Check DHS response**
   - Search `site:x.com/DHSgov [keywords]`
   - Check dhs.gov/news

3. **Find video**
   - YouTube search
   - Check if news articles embed video

4. **Verify citizenship claims**
   - Look for family statements
   - Look for official confirmations
   - Note if disputed

5. **Cross-reference dates/times**
   - Multiple sources should agree on basics

### For Corroborating Social Media

1. Note the date, time, location from post
2. Search news for same incident
3. Look for news outlets that cite the post
4. Check if official response exists
5. Assign trustworthiness based on corroboration

## Red Flags (Don't Document Without Corroboration)

- Single anonymous social media post
- Unverified "friend of a friend" claims
- No specific date/location
- No identifiable victim
- Contradicts known facts
- Only appears on partisan sites
