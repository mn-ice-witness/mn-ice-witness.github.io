# Operation PARRIS

**Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) is a documented ICE operation targeting refugees who entered the United States legally and are awaiting green cards.

## Key Facts

According to reporting, approximately **5,600 green card applicants in Minnesota** are being targeted through this operation. These are individuals who followed every rule, submitted their applications, and are legally present in the country.

Global Refuge has documented that lawfully admitted refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."

## Criteria for Adding Operation PARRIS Context

2. **Pending immigration application** (I-130, green card, etc.)
3. **Detained despite legal presence** (had valid documents, followed proper process)

## Context: Operation PARRIS

[Victim name]'s detention fits a documented pattern of ICE targeting refugees with pending green card applications under **Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening).

## Verification Status

**UNVERIFIED** - The existence of "Operation PARRIS" as a named operation comes from a single GoFundMe campaign. The Twin Cities Pioneer Press article references the 5,600 number but does not independently confirm the operation name. Until mainstream media confirms the operation name, treat this as unverified.

However, the **pattern** of targeting refugees with pending applications is well-documented by multiple sources including Global Refuge and is verifiable.
