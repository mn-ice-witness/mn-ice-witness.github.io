# Operation PARRIS

**Operation PARRIS** (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening) is an official DHS/USCIS operation targeting refugees who entered the United States legally and are awaiting green cards.

## Key Facts

According to DHS, approximately **5,600 refugees in Minnesota** who have not yet received lawful permanent resident status (Green Cards) are being targeted through this operation. These are individuals who followed every rule, submitted their applications, and are legally present in the country.

The operation was announced January 9, 2026, though it began in mid-December 2025. USCIS conducts "thorough background checks, reinterviews, and merit reviews" with fraud cases referred to ICE.

Global Refuge has documented that lawfully admitted refugees are being detained and transported to Texas within 24 hours with "no due process, no access to an attorney."
