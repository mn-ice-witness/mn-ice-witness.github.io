# Scaling Strategy

This document tracks our data scaling decisions, current metrics, and future considerations.

## Current State (Jan 15, 2026)

**Project age:** 2 days (launched Dec 2025, active documentation started Jan 13, 2026)

### Data Metrics
- **Total incidents:** 81
- **Summary file size:** 88 KB (`docs/data/incidents-summary.json`)
- **Individual incident files:** 81 markdown files in `docs/incidents/`

### By Category
| Category | Count | Est. Size |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| immigrants | 31 | ~29 KB |
| observers | 18 | ~16 KB |
| citizens | 17 | ~17 KB |
| response | 9 | ~7 KB |
| schools-hospitals | 9 | ~8 KB |

## Current Architecture Decision

**Decision:** Keep single `incidents-summary.json` file

**Rationale (Jan 15, 2026):**
- 88KB is easily handled by browsers (50-100ms fetch)
- Single HTTP request is faster than 5 on HTTP/2
- LLMs can consume entire dataset in one context window
- Simple architecture, fewer moving parts
- Incidents with dual categories (e.g., HCMC patient incident is both `immigrants` and `schools-hospitals`) don't require duplication or complex handling

## Future Thresholds

Consider revisiting architecture when:

| Metric | Current | Threshold | Action |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Total incidents | 81 | 500+ | Consider splitting by category |
| File size | 88 KB | 500 KB+ | Consider splitting or pagination |
| Single category | 31 | 200+ | Consider sub-categorization |
| Load time | ~100ms | 1s+ | Add loading indicators, consider lazy load |

## Future Options (Not Implemented)

### Option A: Split by Category
Create 5 separate JSON files:
- `incidents-citizens.json`
- `incidents-bystanders.json`
- `incidents-community.json`
- `incidents-schools-hospitals.json`
- `incidents-response.json`

**Pros:** Progressive loading, smaller individual fetches, LLMs can request single category
**Cons:** 5 HTTP requests, dual-category incidents need duplication, more complex code

### Option B: Add Index File
Keep full file, add lightweight `incidents-index.json` (~5KB) with just:
- file paths
- titles
- dates
- types
- notable flag

**Pros:** LLMs can fetch just metadata, best of both worlds
**Cons:** Two files to maintain, marginal benefit at current scale

### Option C: Pagination
Load incidents in batches (e.g., 20 at a time) with infinite scroll.

**Pros:** Fast initial load regardless of total count
**Cons:** Complex implementation, poor for LLM consumption, harder to search

## LLM Consumption Notes

The `incidents-summary.json` file is designed to be LLM-friendly:
- Single file, single fetch
- Structured JSON with consistent schema
- Each incident has: title, summary, date, location, type, sources
- Full incident markdown files available at `filePath` for deep dives

LLMs can:
1. Fetch entire summary for overview analysis
2. Request specific incident markdown files for full details
3. Filter by type, date, or other fields

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-01-15 | Keep single JSON file | 88KB is small, splitting adds complexity without meaningful benefit |
