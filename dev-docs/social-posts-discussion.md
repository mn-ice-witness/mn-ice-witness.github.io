# Social Posts Discussion

## Idea

Add a section (possibly on the About page) collecting remarkable social media posts related to ICE operations in Minnesota.

## Format Options

1. Simple list on About page with links and brief descriptions
2. Dedicated Social page with curated posts
3. Embedded posts (adds complexity, tracking concerns)

## Posts to Track

| Platform | URL | Poster | Description | Engagement |
|----------|-----|--------|-------------|------------|
| Facebook | https://www.facebook.com/reel/906204785493223 | Films For Action | "From a friend in Minneapolis, Minnesota. #AbolishICE" - video from inside car during apparent ICE encounter | 624 reactions, 293 comments, 293 shares |

## Questions

- What makes a post "remarkable" enough to include?
- Should we distinguish between: witness footage, commentary, official statements, community responses?
- How to handle posts that get deleted?
- Attribution/privacy considerations?
