# Social Posts Discussion

## Idea

Add a section (possibly on the About page) collecting remarkable social media posts related to ICE operations in Minnesota.

## Format Options

1. Simple list on About page with links and brief descriptions
2. Dedicated Social page with curated posts
3. Embedded posts (adds complexity, tracking concerns)

## Posts to Track

| Platform | URL | Poster | Description | Engagement |
|----------|-----|--------|-------------|------------|
| Facebook | https://www.facebook.com/reel/906204785493223 | Films For Action | "From a friend in Minneapolis, Minnesota. #AbolishICE" - video from inside car during apparent ICE encounter | 624 reactions, 293 comments, 293 shares |

## Questions

- What makes a post "remarkable" enough to include?
- Should we distinguish between: witness footage, commentary, official statements, community responses?
- How to handle posts that get deleted?
- Attribution/privacy considerations?

### Willmar Student Arrest (Suban Noor)

A Minnesota high school student was grabbed by ICE agents while picking up food for her family after work. She was dragged from her car and put into the back of an unmarked vehicle—in a small town, in the middle of winter.

She had legal refugee status.
